      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how we automate upgrade process. In a nutshell, an upgrade is:
 Upload new artifacts into a running system Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded.  Prerequisites Everything we need before upgrading an NCN.
 NOTE:
The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002. If an action is only needed to run once, developers must add logic to avoid running this action both times the script is executed.</description>

      <title>SLS Updates Expert Mode</title>

      <description>SLS Updates Expert Mode The 1.2 SLS Upgrader aims to make the upgrade of SLS from pre-CMS 1.2 to CSM 1.2 as seamless as possible. However, certain system constraints and subnet sizes quickly necessitate overriding standard input.
Key Takeaways
 EXPERT MODE: requires both an iterative (offline) process and command line override values. The output from the upgrade is a file, not uploaded live to the system. The output logs from an upgrade run should be reviewed to ensure that input values and upgrader subnetting has the desired effect.</description>

      <title>Stage 5 - Perform NCN Personalization</title>
      <link>/docs-csm/en-12/upgrade/1.2/stage_5/</link>

      <description>Stage 5 - Perform NCN Personalization Procedure   Set the root user password and SSH keys before running NCN personalization. The location where the password is stored in Vault has changed since previous CSM versions. See Configure the Root Password and Root SSH Keys in Vault.
  If custom configuration content was merged with content from a previous CSM installation, merge the new CSM configuration in with it in the csm-config-management git repository.</description>

      <description>Upgrade SLS Offline from CSM 1.0.x to CSM 1.2 Abstract During the update of SLS, at a minimum, answers to the following questions must be known prior to upgrading:
  By default in 1.2 non-administrative user traffic will be migrated from the CAN to the CHN while minimizing changes. If you want it to continue to come in via the CAN, or if the site is air-gapped, specify the correct options Will user traffic (non-administrative) come in via the CAN, CHN or is the site air-gapped?</description>

      <description>CSM 1.0.0 or later to 1.2.0 Upgrade Process Introduction This document is intended to guide an administrator through the upgrade process going from Cray Systems Management v1.0 to v1.2. When upgrading a system, this top-level README.md file should be followed top to bottom, and the content on this top level page is meant to be terse. See the additional files in the various directories under the resource_material directory for additional reference material in support of the processes/scripts mentioned explicitly on this page.</description>
