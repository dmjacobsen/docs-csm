      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how we automate upgrade process. In a nutshell, an upgrade is:
 Upload new artifacts into a running system Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded.  Prerequisites Everything we need before upgrading an NCN.
 NOTE:
The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002. If an action is only needed to run once, developers must add logic to avoid running this action both times the script is executed.</description>

      <title>SLS Updates Expert Mode</title>

      <description>SLS Updates Expert Mode The 1.2 SLS Upgrader aims to make the upgrade of SLS from pre-CMS 1.2 to CSM 1.2 as seamless as possible. However, certain system constraints and subnet sizes quickly necessitate overriding standard input.
Key Takeaways
 EXPERT MODE: requires both an iterative (offline) process and command line override values. The output from the upgrade is a file, not uploaded live to the system. The output logs from an upgrade run should be reviewed to ensure that input values and upgrader subnetting has the desired effect.</description>

      <description>Upgrade SLS Offline from CSM 1.0.x to CSM 1.2 Abstract During the update of SLS, at a minimum, answers to the following questions must be known prior to upgrading:
  By default in 1.2 non-administrative user traffic will be migrated from the CAN to the CHN while minimizing changes. If you want it to continue to come in via the CAN, or if the site is air-gapped, specify the correct options Will user traffic (non-administrative) come in via the CAN, CHN or is the site air-gapped?</description>

      <description>CSM 1.0.0 or later to 1.2.0 Upgrade Process Introduction This document is intended to guide an administrator through the upgrade process going from Cray Systems Management v1.0 to v1.2. When upgrading a system, this top-level README.md file should be followed top to bottom, and the content on this top level page is meant to be terse. See the additional files in the various directories under the resource_material directory for additional reference material in support of the processes/scripts mentioned explicitly on this page.</description>

      <description>Stage 1 - Ceph image upgrade Procedure   Run ncn-upgrade-ceph-nodes.sh for ncn-s001. Follow output of the script carefully. The script will pause for manual interaction.
ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/upgrade/ncn-upgrade-ceph-nodes.sh ncn-s001  NOTE: The root password for the node may need to be reset after it is rebooted.
 Known Issues:
  If the below error is observed, then re-run the same command for the node upgrade. It will pick up at that point and continue.</description>
