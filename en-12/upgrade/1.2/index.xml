      <description>SLS Updates Expert mode The 1.2 SLS Upgrader aims to make the upgrade of SLS from pre-CMS 1.2 to CSM 1.2 as seamless as possible. However, certain system constraints and subnet sizes quickly necessitate overriding standard input.
 Key takeaways When to use expert mode Minimal input review Forcing preservation of some existing values Expert mode: Overriding defaults and forced guiding of upgrades  Expert mode: Prerequisites Expert mode: Process Expert mode: Example    Key takeaways  Expert mode requires both an iterative (offline) process and command line override values.</description>

      <description>Upgrade Automation This document describes how we automate upgrade process. In a nutshell, an upgrade is:
 Upload new artifacts into a running system Rebuild each NCN with the newly uploaded images Deploy new charts after all NCNs are upgraded.  Prerequisites Everything we need before upgrading an NCN.
 NOTE:
The prerequisites.sh script is required to run on both ncn-m001 and ncn-m002. If an action is only needed to run once, developers must add logic to avoid running this action both times the script is executed.</description>

      <description>Upgrade SLS Offline from CSM 1.0.x to CSM 1.2 Abstract During the update of SLS, at a minimum, answers to the following questions must be known prior to upgrading:
  By default in 1.2 non-administrative user traffic will be migrated from the CAN to the CHN while minimizing changes. If you want it to continue to come in via the CAN, or if the site is air-gapped, specify the correct options Will user traffic (non-administrative) come in via the CAN, CHN or is the site air-gapped?</description>
