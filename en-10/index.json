This procedure can be done on any x86 machine with the following prerequisites.\nNecessary Software The listed software below will equip a local machine or build server to build for any medium (.squashfs, .vbox, .qcow2, .iso).\n media (.iso, .ovf, or .qcow2) (depending on the layer) packer qemu envsubst  Media Packer can intake any ISO, the sections below detail utilized base ISOs in CRAY HPCaaS.\nFor any ISO, copy it into the iso directory.\nSuSE Linux Enterprise The file name is either:\n SLE-15-SP2-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso  Repositories You will need access to the appropriate SLES repositories in the form of official access, self-hosted access, or the provided Nexus access.\nTo build locally you will need to provide your own repositories file and the custom_repos_file variable must be passed with the packer command. The custom_repos_file variable is a filename that is placed into the custom folder of the project. The file must be formatted with the following fields: url name flags\n -var 'custom_repos_file=custom.repos'  And example entry for a custom repo:\nhttps://myserver.net/sles-mirror/Products/SLE-Module-Basesystem/15-SP3/x86_64/product SUSE-SLE-Module-Basesystem-15-SP3-x86_64-Pool -g -p 99 suse/SLE-Module-Basesystem/15-SP3/x86_64/product\nBuild Steps  There are two Providers that can be built; VirtualBox and QEMU VirtualBox is best for local development. QEMU is best for pipeline and portability on Linux machines. Both outputs are capable of creating the Kernel, Initrd, and SquashFS required to boot nodes.  Setup  Install packer from a reputable endpoint, like this one.  If you are building QEMU images in MacOS, you will need to adjust specific QEMU options:\n MacOS requires HVF for acceleration MacOS uses Cocoa for output -var 'qemu_display=cocoa' -var 'qemu_accelerator=hvf'  Notes  Setup environment variables by copying scripts/environment.template to scripts/environment and modifying the values for your environment. Ensure that SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso is in the iso/ folder Check out csm-rpms repository and create a symlink to it in the root directory of the project. Execute source scripts/environment Execute ./scripts/setup.sh Render the autoinst template  Quick Start git clone \u0026lt;csm-rpms-repo\u0026gt; git clone https://github.com/Cray-HPE/node-image-build.git cd node-image-build ln -s ../csm-rpms/ csm-rpms cp scripts/environment.template scripts/environment vim scripts/environment source scripts/environment mkdir -p iso wget https://\u0026lt;somepath\u0026gt;/SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso -O iso/SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso ./scripts/setup.sh Base Layer The base layer will install SLES 15 and prepare the image for the installation of Kubernetes and Ceph.\nExecute the following commands from the top level of the project\nTo build with QEMU, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=qemu.sles15-base -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/sles15-base/  To build with VirtualBox, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=virtualbox-iso.sles15-base -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/sles15-base/  If you want to view the output of the build, disable headless mode:\n Run packer build -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' -var 'headless=false' boxes/sles15-base/  Once the images are built, the output will be placed in the output-sles15-base directory in the root of the project.\nCommon Layer The common layer starts from the output of the base layer. As such the base layer must be created before building common.\nTo build with QEMU, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=qemu.ncn-common -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-common/  To build with VirtualBox, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=virtualbox-ovf.ncn-common -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-common/  Once the image is built, the output will be placed in the output-ncn-common directory in the root of the project.\nNon-Compute Node Image Layer The ncn-node-images stage builds on top of the common layer to create functional images for Kubernetes and Ceph.\nTo build with QEMU, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=qemu.* -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-node-images/  To build with VirtualBox, run the following command.\n Run packer build -only=virtualbox-ovf.* -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/ncn-node-images/  Once the images are built, the output will be placed in the output-sles15-images directory in the root of the project.\nArtifacts Each layer creates a certain set of artifacts that can be used in different ways.\n Each layer creates a VM disk image that can be directly booted and/or used to create the next layer\u0026rsquo;s image. Each layer after sles15-base creates a list of packages and repos. ncn-common creates kernel and initrd artifacts. ncn-node-images creates Kernel, Initrd, and SquashFS artifacts.  Versioning  The version of the build is passed with the packer build command as the artifact_version var:  packer build -only=qemu.sles15-base -var \u0026#34;artifact_version=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`\u0026#34; -var \u0026#39;ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD\u0026#39; -var \u0026#39;headless=false\u0026#39; boxes/sles15-base/  If no version is passed to the builder then the version none is used when generating the archive.

	"content": "Change Settings for HMS Collector Polling of Air-Cooled Nodes The cray-hms-hmcollector service polls all air-cooled hardware to gather the necessary telemetry information for use by other services, such as the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service. This polling occurs every 10 seconds on a continual basis. Instabilities with the AMI Redfish implementation in the Gigabyte BMCs require a less significant approach when gathering power and temperature telemetry data. If the BMCs are overloaded, they can become unresponsive, return incorrect data, or encounter other errors.\nAll of these issues prevent other services, such as CAPMC and the Firmware Action Service (FAS), from successfully acting on the BMCs. Recovery from this state requires a BMC reset and sometimes a hard power cycle by unplugging the server and plugging it back in.\nCollecting telemetry data while trying to boot air-cooled compute nodes increases the burden on the BMCs and increases the likelihood of BMC issues. The most likely time to encounter BMCs in a bad state is when trying to boot air-cooled compute nodes and User Access Nodes (UANs) using the Boot Orchestration Service, or when trying to do a firmware or BIOS update on the nodes. Check the service logs of CAPMC and FAS for error information returned from the BMCs.\nRecommendations for polling The following are the best practices for using the HMS Collector polling:\n  Do not query the power state of air-cooled nodes using CAPMC more than two or three times a minute.\n  This is done via the CAPMC get_xname_status command.\nncn# cray capmc get_xname_status create --xnames LIST_OF_NODES     Polling of air-cooled nodes should be disabled by default. Before nodes are booted, verify that cray-hms-hmcollector polling is disabled.\n  To check if polling is disabled:\nncn# kubectl get deployments.apps -n services cray-hms-hmcollector -o json | \\  jq \u0026#39;.spec.template.spec.containers[].env[]|select(.name==\u0026#34;POLLING_ENABLED\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;   To disable polling, if it is not already:\nncn# kubectl edit deployment -n services cray-hms-hmcollector Change the value for the POLLING_ENABLED environment variable to false in the spec: section. Save and quit the editor for the changes to take effect. The cray-hms-hmcollector pod will automatically restart.\n    Only enable telemetry polling when needed, such as when running jobs.\nncn# kubectl edit deployment -n services cray-hms-hmcollector Change the value for the POLLING_ENABLED environment variable to true in the spec: section. Save and quit the editor for the changes to take effect. The cray-hms-hmcollector pod will automatically restart.\n  If BMCs are encountering issues at a high rate, increase the polling interval. Do not set the polling interval to less than the default of 10 seconds.\nncn# kubectl edit deployment -n services cray-hms-hmcollector Change the value for the POLLING_INTERVAL environment variable to the selected rate in seconds. This value is located in the spec: section. Save and quit the editor for the changes to take effect. The cray-hms-hmcollector pod will automatically restart.\n  Reset BMCs in a bad state Even with the polling recommendations above, it is still possible for the BMCs to end up in a bad state, necessitating a reset.\nTo restart the BMCs:\n read -s is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.\n ncn# USERNAME=root ncn# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD ncn# export IPMI_PASSWORD ncn# ipmitool -H BMC_HOSTNAME -U $USERNAME -E -I lanplus mc reset cold If the reset does not recover the BMCs, then use the following steps to shut down the nodes, unplug the servers, and plug them back in:\n  Shut down the nodes.\nFor each server with a BMC in a bad state:\nncn# ipmitool -H BMC_HOSTNAME -U $USERNAME -E -I lanplus chassis power soft Wait 30 seconds after shutting down the nodes before proceeding.\n  Unplug the server Power Supply Units (PSUs) and wait 30 seconds.\n  Plug both server PSUs back in.\nWait at least two minutes before proceeding.\n  Verify that the BMCs are available again.\nncn# ping -c 1 BMC_HOSTNAME   Check the power of the nodes.\nncn# cray capmc get_xname_status create --xnames LIST_OF_NODES   After these steps, the nodes should be ready to be booted again with the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS).\n"

	"content": "Configuration of NCN Bonding Non-compute nodes (NCNs) have network interface controllers (NICs) connected to the management network that are configured in a redundant manner via Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) link aggregation. The link aggregation configuration can be modified by editing and applying various configuration files either through Ansible or the interfaces directly.\nThe bond configuration exists across three files on an NCN. These files may vary depending on the NCN in use:\n  ifcfg-bond0\nPhysical configuration and member interfaces.\n  ifroute-bond0\nRouting, which is critical for NCN PXE to work.\n  ifrule-bond0\nRouting table selecting, which is critical for NCN PXE to work.\n  The following is an example of ifcfg-bond0:\nncn-w001# cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-bond0 BONDING_MASTER=\u0026#39;yes\u0026#39; BONDING_MODULE_OPTS=\u0026#39;mode=802.3ad miimon=100 lacp_rate=fast xmit_hash_policy=layer2+3\u0026#39; BONDING_SLAVE0=\u0026#39;p1p1\u0026#39; BONDING_SLAVE1=\u0026#39;p1p2\u0026#39; MTU=\u0026#39;9238\u0026#39; STARTMODE=\u0026#39;auto\u0026#39; BOOTPROTO=\u0026#39;static\u0026#39; PREFIXLEN=\u0026#39;16\u0026#39; IPADDR=\u0026#39;10.1.1.1/16\u0026#39; ZONE=\u0026#39;Do not assign ZONE\u0026#39; The bond is configured with modules that can be changed at the network administrators discretion and coordination.\nIt may be useful to only adjust the XMIT value to layer2; the current setting is chosen as a default to match existing settings for compute nodes from the previous release. This can be weighed out if problems arise across the NCNs over the bond and dual-spine or Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG).\nWicked NetworkManager Wicked is the SUSE NetworkManager and Daemon wrapper for handling interfaces' processes and applying their configuration. See the SUSE Wicked external documentation for more information.\nFor administrators familiar with the more common Linux distribution, Ubuntu, it has an analogue to Wicked called NetPlan.

This can result in problems with time syncing correctly. This section describes how to diagnose and fix these.\nThese issues all relate to certain nodes not being in a correct state.\nCorrect State ncn-m001 should have these important settings in /etc/chrony.d/cray.conf:\nserver time.nist.gov iburst trust # or pool time.nist.gov iburst # ncn-m001 should NOT use itself as a server and is known to cause issues # this allows the clock to step itself during a restart without affecting running apps if it drifts more than 1 second initstepslew 1 time.nist.gov # the other ncns are set to 10, so in the event of a tie, ncn-m001 is chosen as the leader local stratum 8 orphan These settings ensure there is a low-stratum NTP server that ncn-m001 has access to. ncn-m001 also has the following:\n# all non-ncn-m001 NCNs use ncn-m001 as their server, and they trust it server ncn-m001 iburst trust # no pools are on the other ncns # ncn-m001 should NOT use itself as a server and is known to cause issues # this allows the clock to step itself during a restart without affecting running apps if it drifts more than 1 second initstepslew 1 ncn-m001 # the ncns peer with each other at a high stratum, and choose ncn-m001 (stratum 8 or lower) in the event of a tie local stratum 10 orphan # The nodes should have a max of 9 peers and should not include themselves in the list peer ncn-m001 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-m003 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-s001 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-s002 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-s003 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-w001 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-w002 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst peer ncn-w003 minpoll -2 maxpoll 9 iburst Quick Fixes Fix BSS Metadata If nodes are missing metadata for NTP, you will be required to generate the data using csi and your system\u0026rsquo;s system_config.yaml. If you do not have your seed data in the system_config.yaml then you will need to open a ticket to help generate the NTP data.\nThe following steps are structured to be executed on one node at a time. However, step #3 will generate all relevant files for each node. If multiple nodes are missing NTP data in BSS, you can apply this fix to each node.\n Update system_config.yaml to have the correct NTP settings: ntp-servers: - ncn-m001 - time.nist.gov ntp-timezone: UTC  Generate new configurations: ncn# csi config init  In the newly created system/basecamp directory, copy in and execute the metadata script that is included in the upgrade scripts of this documentation: ncn# ./upgrade_ntp_timezone_metadata.sh  Find the relevant file(s) to the node(s) with missing metadata, such as upgrade-metadata-000000000000.json based on the MAC address of the node. Find the component name (xname) for the node that needs to be fixed: ncn# cat /etc/cray/xname  From ncn-m001 execute the following command to update BSS: ncn# csi handoff bss-update-cloud-init --user-data=\u0026#34;upgrade-metadata-000000000000.json\u0026#34; --limit=\u0026lt;xname\u0026gt;`  Obtain the updated cloud-init code and template files from the scripts directory in the CSM documentation RPM: ncn# cp ./usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/cc_ntp.py /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cloudinit/config/cc_ntp.py ncn# cp ./usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/chrony.conf.cray.tmpl /etc/cloud/templates/chrony.conf.cray.tmpl   Alternatively, you can download the latest versions from Github: bash ncn# wget -O /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cloudinit/config/cc_ntp.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cray-HPE/metal-cloud-init/main/cloudinit/config/cc_ntp.py` ncn# wget -O /etc/cloud/templates/chrony.conf.cray.tmpl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cray-HPE/metal-cloud-init/main/config/cray.conf.j2`\n Continue with the upgrade. When the upgrade is completed there might be extra files and configurations, execute the following steps to clean up NTP if required:  Remove pool.conf on all nodes: ncn# rm /etc/chrony.d/pool.conf  Remove cray.conf.dist on all nodes: ncn# rm /etc/chrony.d/cray.conf.dist  Comment out the default pool line in /etc/chrony.conf on all nodes: ncn# sed -i \u0026#39;s/^\\!/#/\u0026#39; /etc/chrony.conf  Restart chronyd on all nodes: ncn# systemctl restart chronyd     Fix ncn-m001 Most of the bugs from CSM 0.9 carried forward with upgrades. Most commonly, ncn-m001 is the problem because it either does not have a valid upstream server, or it has a bad configuration. This can be quickly remedied by running three commands to download the latest cc_ntp module, download an updated template, and re-run cloud-init.\nncn-m001# wget -O /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cloudinit/config/cc_ntp.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cray-HPE/metal-cloud-init/main/cloudinit/config/cc_ntp.py ncn-m001# wget -O /etc/cloud/templates/chrony.conf.cray.tmpl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cray-HPE/metal-cloud-init/main/config/cray.conf.j2 ncn-m001# cloud-init single --name ntp --frequency always Fix other NCNs The other NCNs sometimes have the wrong stratum set or are missing the initstepslew directive. These can be added in fairly quickly with some sed commands:\nIncrease the stratum on NCNs (other than ncn-m001):\nncn# sed -i \u0026#34;s/local stratum 3 orphan/local stratum 10 orphan/\u0026#34; /etc/chrony.d/cray.conf Add a new line after the logchange directive\nncn# sed -i \u0026#34;/^\\(logchange 1.0\\)\\$/a initstepslew 1 ncn-m001\u0026#34; /etc/chrony.d/cray.conf Restart chronyd\nncn# systemctl restart chronyd Customize NTP Set A Local Timezone This procedure needs to be completed on the PIT node before the other management nodes are deployed.\nConfigure NTP on PIT to Local Timezone HPE Cray EX systems with CSM software have UTC as the default time zone. To change this, you will need to set an environment variable, as well as chroot into the node images and change some files there. You can find a list of timezones to use in the commands below by running timedatectl list-timezones.\n  Run the following commands, replacing them with your timezone as needed.\npit# export NEWTZ=America/Chicago pit# echo -e \u0026#34;\\nTZ=${NEWTZ}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/environment pit# sed -i \u0026#34;s#^timedatectl set-timezone UTC#timedatectl set-timezone ${NEWTZ}#\u0026#34; /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh pit# sed -i \u0026#39;s/--utc/--localtime/\u0026#39; /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh pit# /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh   The configure-ntp.sh script should have the information for your local timezone in the output.\npit# /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh Example output:\nCURRENT TIME SETTINGS rtc: 2021-03-26 11:34:45.873331+00:00 sys: 2021-03-26 11:34:46.015647+0000 200 OK 200 OK NEW TIME SETTINGS rtc: 2021-03-26 06:35:16.576477-05:00 sys: 2021-03-26 06:35:17.004587-0500   Verify the new timezone setting by running timedatectl and hwclock --verbose.\npit# timedatectl Local time: Fri 2021-03-26 06:35:58 CDT Universal time: Fri 2021-03-26 11:35:58 UTC RTC time: Fri 2021-03-26 11:35:58 Time zone: America/Chicago (CDT, -0500) Network time on: no NTP synchronized: no RTC in local TZ: no pit# hwclock --verbose hwclock from util-linux 2.33.1 System Time: 1616758841.688220 Trying to open: /dev/rtc0 Using the rtc interface to the clock.

This is accomplished by chrooting into the unsquashed images, making some modifications, re-squashing them, and moving the new images into place. This is included as an optional image modification step in the two procedures below.\n  If the PIT node is booted, see Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys on PIT Node for more information.\nNote: Make a note that when performing the csi handoff of NCN boot artifacts in Redeploy PIT Node, you must be sure to specify these new images. Otherwise ncn-m001 will use the default timezone when it boots, and subsequent reboots of the other NCNs will also lose the customized timezone changes.\n  If the PIT node is not booted, see Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys for more information.\n  "

The new cabinets have been cabled up to the system, and the system\u0026rsquo;s cabling has been validated to be correct. Follow the procedure Create a Backup of the SLS Postgres Database. Follow the procedure Create a Backup of the HSM Postgres Database. Backup running-config on all management switches. Export switch backup to CSM R\u0026amp;D.  Procedure   Perform procedures in Add Liquid-Cooled Cabinets to SLS.\n  Reconfigure management network:\n Obtain updated switch configs from CSM R\u0026amp;D. Verify/Update current configuration on management network switches. Verify new switches are at factory defaults. Upgrade new switch firmware. Load switch configs onto new switches. Rack and cable new switches. Power on new switches.    Perform procedures in Updating Cabinet Routes on Management NCNs.\n  Verify new hardware has been discovered by performing the Hardware State Manager Discovery Validation procedure. After the management network has been reconfigured, it may take up to 10 minutes for the hardware in the new cabinets to become discovered.\n  Perform procedures in Update Firmware with FAS to validate BIOS and BMC firmware levels in the new nodes, and perform updates as needed with FAS.\n Slingshot Switches are updated with procedures from the Slingshot Operations Guide.\n   Continue on to the Slingshot Operations Guide to bring up the additional cabinets.\nNOTE: Placeholder: Provide a link to the procedure once ready.\n  "

The CA trust bundle can also be modified at any time. When this is to be done, the following steps are needed:\n  Modify the CA trust bundle.\nOnce the CA trust bundle is modified, each service will automatically pick up the new CA bundle data. There is no manual step.\n  Regenerate the TLS cabinet-level certificates as done is the preceding step.\n  Place the TLS certificates onto the Redfish BMCs as in the preceding step.\n  "

Kea automatically adds entries to the HSM ethernetInterfaces table when DHCP lease is provided (about every 5 minutes). To prevent from Kea from automatically adding MAC entries to the HSM ethernetInterfaces table, use the following commands:\n  Create an eth_interfaces file that contains the interface IDs for the Node Maintenance Network entries for the destination blade location.\nIf there has not been a blade previously in the destination location there may not be any Ethernet Interfaces to delete from HSM.\nThe blade_query.sh script from the perquisites section can help determine the IDs for the HSM Ethernet Interfaces associated with the blade if any. It is expected that if a blade has not been populated in the slot before that no HSM Ethernet Interfaces IDs would be found.\nncn-m001# cat eth_interfaces 0040a6836339 0040a683633a 0040a68362e2 0040a68362e3   Run the following commands in succession to remove the interfaces if any. Delete the cray-dhcp-kea pod to prevent the interfaces from being re-created.\nncn-m001# kubectl get pods -Ao wide | grep kea ncn-m001# kubectl delete -n services pod CRAY_DHCP_KEA_PODNAME ncn-m001# for ETH in $(cat eth_interfaces); do cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces delete $ETH --format json ; done   Skip this step if the destination blade location has not been previously populated with a blade.

	"content": "Alpha Framework to Add, Remove, Replace, or Move NCNs Add, remove, replace, or move non-compute nodes (NCNs). This applies to worker, storage, or master nodes. Use this procedure in the event that:\n Worker, storage, or master nodes are being replaced and the MAC address is changing. Worker or storage nodes are being added. Worker, storage, or master nodes are being moved to a different cabinet.  IMPORTANT: Always maintain at least two of the first three worker, storage, and master nodes when adding, removing, replacing, or moving NCNs.\nThe following workflows are available:\n Prerequisites Add Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs  Add NCN Prerequisites Add NCN Procedure   Remove Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs  Remove NCN Prerequisites Remove NCN Procedure   Replace or Move Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs  Prerequisites The system is fully installed and has transitioned off of the LiveCD.\nAll activities required for site maintenance are complete.\nThe latest docs-csm RPM has been installed on the master nodes. See Update CSM Product Stream for more information.\n  Run ncn_add_pre-req.py to adjust the network.\nncn-m# cd /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/node_management/Add_Remove_Replace_NCNs/ ncn-m# ./ncn_add_pre-req.py   The script will ask the following question:\n How many NCNs would you like to add? Do not include NCNs to be removed or moved.    Example output:\nThe prerequisite script prepares adding NCNs by adjusting SLS network configurations. Please enter answer as an integer. How many NCNs would you like to add? Do not include NCNs to be removed or moved. 10 You are about to make DESTRUCTIVE changes to the system and will need to restart DVS.

Set NODE to the hostname of the node being added (for example ncn-w001, ncn-s002, etc).\nncn# NODE=ncn-x00n If the component name (xname) is known, set it now. Otherwise it will be determined in a later step.\nncn# XNAME=\u0026lt;xname\u0026gt; ncn# echo $XNAME IMPORTANT: Ensure that the node being added to the system has been properly configured. If the node being added to the system has not been previously in the system, several settings need to be verified.\n  Ensure that the NCN device to be added has been racked and cabled per the SHCD.\n  Ensure the NCN BMC is configured with the expected root user credentials.\nThe NCN BMC credentials needs to match the current global air-cooled BMC default credentials. This can be viewed with the following command:\nncn-m# VAULT_PASSWD=$(kubectl -n vault get secrets cray-vault-unseal-keys -o json | jq -r \u0026#39;.data[\u0026#34;vault-root\u0026#34;]\u0026#39; | base64 -d) ncn-m# kubectl -n vault exec -it cray-vault-0 -c vault -- env \\  VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_PASSWD VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 \\  vault kv get secret/reds-creds/defaults Example output:\n==== Data ==== Key Value --- ----- Cray map[password:foobar username:root]   If adding an NCN that was not previously in the system, follow the Access and Update the Settings for Replacement NCNs procedure.\n  Ensure the NCN BMC is configured to use DHCP. (This does not apply to the BMC for ncn-m001, because it is statically configured for the site.)\n  Ensure that the NCN is configured to boot over the PCIe NICs instead of the Onboard 1 Gig NICs using the Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe procedure.\n  If adding an HPE NCN, ensure that IPMI is enabled.\n  Check to see if IPMI is enabled:\n read -s is used to read the password in order to prevent it from being echoed to the screen or saved in the shell history.

For several of the commands in this section, you will need to have variables set with the name of the node being removed and its xname. Set NODE to the hostname of the node being removed (for example ncn-w001, ncn-s002, etc). Set XNAME to the xname of that node.\nncn# NODE=ncn-x00n ncn# XNAME=$(ssh $NODE cat /etc/cray/xname) ncn# echo $XNAME Remove NCN Procedure The following is a high-level overview of the remove NCN workflow:\n  Remove NCN from Role, Wipe the Disks, and Power Down\n  Remove NCN data from SLS, BSS and HSM\n  Remove Switch Configuration\n  Redeploy Services\n  Validate Health\n  IMPORTANT: Update the SHCD to remove the device. This is only needed if no NCN device will be added back to same location with the same cabling.\nReplace or Move Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs Replacing an NCN is defined as removing an NCN of a given type and adding a different NCN of the same type (but with different MAC addresses) back into the same cabinet slot. Moving an NCN is defined as removing an NCN of a given type from one cabinet and adding it back into a different cabinet.\nUse the Remove Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs procedure followed by the Add Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs procedure to replace a worker, storage, or master node (NCN). In general, scaling master nodes is not recommended because it can cause Etcd latency.\nReplace NCN Procedure The following is a high-level overview of the replace NCN workflow:\n  Remove Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs\n  Add Worker, Storage, or Master NCNs\n  "

	"content": "Management Network Flow Control Settings This page is designed to go over all the flow control settings for Dell/Mellanox systems.\nLeaf Switch Node Connections For the node connections to a leaf switch, disable the transmit flowcontrol and enable receive flowcontrol with the following commands:\nNOTE: If using a TDS system involving a Hill cabinet, make sure to confirm that no CMM nor CEC components are connected to any leaf switches in your system. If these components are connected to the leaf, confirm to which ports they are connected, and modify the commands below to avoid modifying the flowcontrol settings of those ports.\nsw-leaf-001# configure terminal sw-leaf-001(config)# interface range ethernet 1/1/1-1/1/48 sw-leaf-001(conf-range-eth1/1/1-1/1/48)# flowcontrol receive on sw-leaf-001(conf-range-eth1/1/1-1/1/48)# flowcontrol transmit off sw-leaf-001(conf-range-eth1/1/1-1/1/48)# end sw-leaf-001# write memory Switch-to-Switch Connections for MLAG, VLT, or VSX Flowcontrol is supposed to be enabled on the IPL for Mellanox MLAG. Flowcontrol settings are defined elsewhere for the links between redundant Dell, Mellanox, or Aruba switches. This includes IPL and keepalive interfaces. This document is not relevant for those links.\nThe configuration below is supposed to be on for Mellanox MLAG:\n dcb priority-flow-control enable force interface port-channel 100 dcb priority-flow-control mode on force Switch-to-Switch Connections Disable flowcontrol in both directions for all switch-to-switch connections: spine-to-leaf; spine-to-CDU; spine-to-aggregate; and aggregate-to-leaf (It is unlikely that any system has every type of connection).\nHow to identify which ports are part of a switch-to-switch connection will be covered first, and then the commands to make the changes. The commands for each switch group are provided separately, but it is strongly recommended to make the configuration changes for each end of the connection in short order; for example, for a spine-leaf connection, do not make the changes on the spine side if changes cannot also be made to the leaf switch end of the connection within a couple minutes. Repeat the above commands for each leaf switch in the system. These changes can be performed before the switch-to-switch connections, or concurrent with those changes.\nRecommended order of flow control changes for switch-to-switch connections:\n Make change on sw-spine-001 side of leaf/aggregate/CDU ISL connections. Make change on sw-spine-002 side of leaf/aggregate/CDU ISL connections. Make change on leaf/aggregate/CDU side of spine ISL connections. Make change on aggregate01/CDU01 side of VLT ISL connections. Make change on aggregate02/CDU02 side of VLT ISL connections. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each aggregate/CDU switch pair. Make change on aggregate side of leaf ISL connections. Make change on leaf side of aggregate ISL connections.  Identify Switch-to-Switch Connections Leaf Switches Our standard for the configuration uses \u0026lsquo;port-channel 100\u0026rsquo; for the connection to the spine or aggregate switch. To get what ports are part of this composite interface, use the following command:\nsw-leaf-001# show interface port-channel 100 summary LAG Mode Status Uptime Ports 100 L2-HYBRID up 2 weeks 5 days 01:2 Eth 1/1/51 (Up) Eth 1/1/52 (Up) The physical ports in this example are \u0026lsquo;1/1/51\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;1/1/52\u0026rsquo;. Record this information for each leaf switch.\nCDU Switches In order to get the ports involved in the connection to the spine switches, use the command shared for the leaf switch above.\nThe ports connecting the pair of CDU switches together is also required. The best way to determine the ports involved is to run the following command:\nsw-cdu-001# show running-configuration | grep discovery discovery-interface ethernet1/1/25,1/1/29 The ports 1/1/25 and 1/1/29 in this example are being used as connections between the CDU switches. As with the connection to the spine, record the ports involved.\nNOTE: It is very important that the flowcontrol settings for the CMM and CEC devices connected to the CDU switches NOT be modified.\nAggregate Switches On large air-cooled systems, aggregate switches are situated between the leaf and spine switches. In general, it is expected that every port that is up on these switches to either be a connection to the spine (as \u0026lsquo;port-channel 100\u0026rsquo;), a connection to a leaf, or a connection to its peer aggregate switch. To see which ports are currently up, run the following command:\nsw-10g01# show interface status -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Port Description Status Speed Duplex Mode Vlan Tagged-Vlans -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Eth 1/1/1 LEAF_CONN_1 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/2 LEAF_CONN_2 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/3 LEAF_CONN_3 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/4 LEAF_CONN_4 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/5 LEAF_CONN_5 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/6 LEAF_CONN_6 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/7 LEAF_CONN_7 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/8 LEAF_CONN_8 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/9 LEAF_CONN_9 up 10G full - Eth 1/1/10 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/11 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/12 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/13 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/14 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/15 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/16 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/17 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/18 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/19 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/20 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/21 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/22 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/23 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/24 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/25 up 100G full - Eth 1/1/26 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/27 up 40G full - Eth 1/1/28 up 40G full - Eth 1/1/29 up 100G full - Eth 1/1/30 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/31 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/32 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/33 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/34 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/35 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/36 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/37 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/38 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/39 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/40 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/41 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/42 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/43 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/44 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/45 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/46 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/47 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/48 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/49 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/50 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/51 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/52 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/53 down 0 full A 1 - Eth 1/1/54 down 0 full A 1 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From the output in this example, ports 1/1/1 through 1/1/9, 1/1/25, and 1/1/27 through 1/1/29 are up. Record this information.\nSpine Switches The convenient way to identify the ports involved with connections to other switches is to look at the output from show interface status.\nsw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # show interfaces status -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Port Operational state Admin Speed MTU Description -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- mgmt1 Down Enabled UNKNOWN 1500 - mgmt0 Down Enabled UNKNOWN 1500 - Po100 Up Enabled 9216 mlag-isl Mpo1 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo2 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo3 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo4 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo5 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo6 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo7 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo8 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo9 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo10 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo11 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo17 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo113 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo151 Up Enabled 9216 - Mpo152 Up Enabled 9216 - Eth1/1 (Mpo1) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/2 (Mpo2) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/3 (Mpo3) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/4 (Mpo4) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/5 (Mpo5) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/6 (Mpo6) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/7 (Mpo7) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/8 (Mpo8) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/9 (Mpo9) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/10 (Mpo10) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/11 (Mpo11) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/12 (Po100) Up Enabled 40G 9216 sw-spine-002-1/12 Eth1/13 (Mpo113) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/14 (Mpo113) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/15/1 (Mpo151) Up Enabled 10G 9216 - Eth1/15/2 (Mpo152) Up Enabled 10G 9216 - Eth1/15/3 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/15/4 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/17 (Mpo17) Up Enabled 40G 9216 - Eth1/18 (Po100) Up Enabled 40G 9216 sw-spine-002-1/18 Eth1/19 Up Enabled 10G 1500 - Eth1/20 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/21 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/22 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/23 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/24 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/25 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/26 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/27 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/28 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/29 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/30 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/31 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 - Eth1/32 Down Enabled Unknown 1500 The links between the 2 spines should be port-channel 100 (Po100). The mlag-port-channel interfaces which are connections to leaf, aggregate, or CDU switches would be Mpo interfaces with indices greater than 100. So here, Mpo1-Mpo11 and Mpo17 are connections to NCNs, whereas Mpo113, Mpo151, and Mpo152 are connections to other switches. When identifying the port-channel and mlag-port-channel devices, look for the Eth rows, which have one of these labels in parentheses next to it. In the example above, these are:\n Eth1/12 Eth1/13 Eth1/14 Eth1/15/1 Eth1/15/2 Eth1/18  Record these ports AND the port-channel and mlag-port-channel interfaces.\nSpine Switch \u0026lsquo;flowcontrol\u0026rsquo; Configuration Change On the Mellanox spine switches, modify the flowcontrol settings on the port-channel, mlag-port-channel, and Ethernet interfaces. The general form looks similar to the following:\nsw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # configure terminal sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface port-channel \u0026lt;index\u0026gt; flowcontrol receive off force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface port-channel \u0026lt;index\u0026gt; flowcontrol send off force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface mlag-port-channel \u0026lt;index\u0026gt; flowcontrol receive off force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface mlag-port-channel \u0026lt;index\u0026gt; flowcontrol send off force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface ethernet \u0026lt;port\u0026gt; flowcontrol receive off force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # interface ethernet \u0026lt;port\u0026gt; flowcontrol send off force sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # exit sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # write memory \u0026ldquo;index\u0026rdquo; is the number after \u0026ldquo;Po\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Mpo\u0026rdquo;, so \u0026ldquo;113\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;151\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; would be the value after \u0026ldquo;Eth\u0026rdquo;, so \u0026ldquo;1/14\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;1/15/2\u0026rdquo;. Make sure to run the flowcontrol commands for each mlag-port-channel and Ethernet port.\nLeaf, CDU, and Aggregate Switch \u0026lsquo;flowcontrol\u0026rsquo; Configuration Change On the Dell switches, only modify the Ethernet interface configurations. The general form looks similar to the following:\nsw-leaf-001# configure terminal sw-leaf-001(config)# interface ethernet \u0026lt;port\u0026gt; sw-leaf-001(conf-if-eth\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;)# flowcontrol receive off sw-leaf-001(conf-if-eth\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;)# flowcontrol transmit off sw-leaf-001(conf-if-eth\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;)# end sw-leaf-001# write memory Do this for each port. Alternatively, set it up to do multiple ports as one command. For instance, the common leaf switch would have ports 51 and 52 as connections to the spine. So in that case, these commands would work:\nsw-leaf-001# configure terminal sw-leaf-001(config)# interface range ethernet 1/1/51-1/1/52 sw-leaf-001(conf-if-eth1/1/51-1/1/52)# flowcontrol receive off sw-leaf-001(conf-if-eth1/1/51-1/1/52)# flowcontrol transmit off sw-leaf-001(conf-if-eth1/1/51-1/1/52)# end sw-leaf-001# write memory Alternatively, a typical CDU switch would have ports 27 and 28 as uplinks to the spine, with ports 25 and 29 as connections to the peer CDU switch. So in that case, use the following commands:\nsw-cdu-001# configure terminal sw-cdu-001(config)# interface range ethernet 1/1/25,1/1/27-1/1/29 sw-cdu-001(conf-range-eth1/1/25,1/1/27-1/1/29)# flowcontrol receive off sw-cdu-001(conf-range-eth1/1/25,1/1/27-1/1/29)# flowcontrol transmit off sw-cdu-001(conf-range-eth1/1/25,1/1/27-1/1/29)# end sw-cdu-001# write memory Disable iSCSI on Dell Switches (Leaf, CDU, and Aggregate) The final configuration change needed on the Dell switches is to disable iSCSI in the configuration. This change ensures that all of the flowcontrol changes made above will persist through a reboot of the switch.\nRun the following commands on all Dell switches in the system:\nsw-leaf-001# configure terminal sw-leaf-001(config)# no iscsi enable sw-leaf-001(config)# exit sw-leaf-001# write memory "

	"content": "Management Network Switch Rename Any system moving from Shasta v1.3 to Shasta v1.4 software needs to adjust the hostnames and IP addresses for all switches to match the new standard. There is now a virtual IP address ending in .1 which is used by spine switches. In Shasta v1.3, the first spine switch used the .1 address. In Shasta v1.4, the ordering of the switches has changed with spine switches being grouped first. The hostname for switches has changed from two digits to a dash and then 3 digits. All IPv4 data for the switches and switch naming comes from Cray Site Init (CSI).\nCurrently, the ordering of the switches has changed with spine switches being grouped first. The hostname for switches has changed from two digits to a dash followed by three digits. All IPv4 data for the switches and switch naming comes from Cray Site Init (CSI).\nFrom v1.3, this example system had these IP addresses and hostnames on the Hardware Management Network (HMN). Similar names and IP address numbers for the Node Management Network (NMN) and Customer Access Network (CAN) as well. Also note that some systems may not have an agg or aggregation set of switches.

	"content": "MetalLB in BGP-Mode MetalLB is a component in Kubernetes that manages access to LoadBalancer services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. There are LoadBalancer services on the Node Management Network (NMN), Hardware Management Network (HMN), and Customer Access Network (CAN).\nMetalLB can run in either Layer2-mode or BGP-mode for each address pool it manages. BGP-mode is used for the NMN, HMN, and CAN. This enables true load balancing (Layer2-mode does failover, not load balancing) and allows for a more robust layer 3 configuration for these networks.\nIn BGP-mode, the MetalLB speakers will peer with the BGP router on the spine switches and advertise the service LoadBalancer IP addresses. The BGP routers will accept those advertised prefixes and add them to the route table. The spines are configured with Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP), meaning that each of these BGP route prefixes will load balance to any of the workers that has advertised the prefix. This process allows clients outside the cluster with access to the NMN, HMN, or CAN to be able to route to these Kubernetes services.\nBGP peering is only between the MetalLB speakers and the spine switches. It does not do any peering beyond that.\nThe routes in the BGP route table will only be the IP addresses of the Kubernetes LoadBalancer services. This is the fifth column displayed in the output of the following command:\nncn-w001# kubectl get service -A | grep LoadBalancer For example:\nNAMESPACE NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP **EXTERNAL-IP** PORT(S) AGE ceph-rgw cray-s3 LoadBalancer 10.31.54.80 10.102.10.129 8080:31003/TCP 36d ims cray-ims-40f523ac-9b99-4f76-bb37-df6eb62540c8-service LoadBalancer 10.21.156.88 10.102.10.134 22:31604/TCP 35d ims cray-ims-50287398-b877-4a2b-bf18-c3618583c66f-service LoadBalancer 10.29.254.221 10.102.10.167 22:30314/TCP 12d ims cray-ims-577dec6e-dbac-4363-a423-bf39ed9b9e32-service LoadBalancer 10.22.200.115 10.102.10.158 22:32672/TCP 15d ims cray-ims-5b05e86e-f65b-4a5f-b5eb-2c31f0458722-service LoadBalancer 10.25.162.244 10.102.10.160 22:32707/TCP 14d ims cray-ims-7ffaf10f-75ca-4ccb-b10d-1c7cd31b3d4b-service LoadBalancer 10.20.16.190 10.102.10.132 22:31934/TCP 35d ims cray-ims-b1cd0827-bb51-4bcd-ac25-f64d5f7d0c44-service LoadBalancer 10.26.69.180 10.102.10.131 22:31281/TCP 35d ims cray-ims-bd0698b4-a104-48eb-9714-5b5889ad7b52-service LoadBalancer 10.18.114.136 10.102.10.135 22:31701/TCP 35d MetalLB does not manage access to any of the NCNs, UANs, or compute nodes.\n"

	"content": "MetalLB in BGP-Mode Configuration MetalLB in BGP-mode provides a more robust configuration for the Node Management Network (NMN), Hardware Management Network (HMN), and Customer Access Network (CAN). This configuration is generated from the csi config init input values. BGP-mode is enabled by updating the protocols in these configuration files.\nMetalLB Peer Configuration The content for metallb_bgp_peers is generated by the csi config init command. In addition to the MetalLB configuration, there is configuration needed on the spine switches to set up the BGP router on these switches.\nThe MetalLB ConfigMap can also be viewed:\npeers: - peer-address: 10.252.0.1 peer-asn: 65533 my-asn: 65533 - peer-address: 10.252.0.3 peer-asn: 65533 my-asn: 65533 To retrieve data about BGP peers:\nncn-m001# kubectl get cm config -n metallb-system The speakers get their peering configuration from the MetalLB ConfigMap. This configuration specifies the IP address of the spine or aggregate switch, as well as the Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the speaker and the switch with which it is peering. This ASN should be the same for both.\nCAN Configuration This network has two MetalLB address pools, one for static IP allocation and the other for dynamic IP allocation. Static allocation guarantees the same IP allocation for services using this pool across deployment and installations. Dynamic allocations means that the allocated IP addresses will be in this pool, but may change depending on the timing and ordering of the IP allocation.\nView the address pool configurations in the MetalLB ConfigMap after localization occurs. The MetalLB ConfigMap should not be edited directly. The following is an example of the values in the ConfigMap:\n- name: can-dynamic-pool **protocol: bgp** addresses: **- 10.102.5.128/25** - name: can-static-pool **protocol: bgp** addresses: **- 10.102.5.112/28** The CAN configuration is set in the csi config init input:\nlinux# csi config init . . . --can-cidr 10.102.5.0/26 --can-gateway 10.102.5.27 --can-static-pool 10.102.5.28/30 --can-dynamic-pool 10.102.5.32/27 . . .

	"content": "Update BGP Neighbors This page will detail the manual procedure to configure and verify BGP neighbors on the management switches.\nYou will not have BGP peers until CSM install.sh has run. This is where MetalLB is deployed.\n How do I check the status of the BGP neighbors?  Log into the spine switches and run show bgp ipv4 unicast summary for Aruba/HPE switches and show ip bgp summary for Mellanox.   Are my Neighbors stuck in IDLE?  Running clear ip bgp all on the Mellanox and clear bgp * on the Arubas will restart the BGP process. This process may need to be done when a system is reinstalled or when a worker node is rebuilt. If you cannot get the neighbors out of IDLE, make sure that passive neighbors are configured. This is in the automated scripts and shown in the example below. Passive neighbors should only be configured on NCN neighbors.   The BGP neighbors will be the worker NCN IP addresses on the NMN (node management network) (VLAN002). If your system is using HPE/Aruba, one of the neighbors will be the other spine switch.  Generate MetalLB configmap  Depending on the network architecture of your system you may need to peer with switches other than the spines. CSI has a BGP peers argument that accepts \u0026lsquo;aggregation\u0026rsquo; as an option, if no option is defined it will default to the spines as being the MetalLB peers.  CSI CLI arguments with --bgp-peers aggregation\nlinux# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme linux# csi config init --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user root --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass $IPMI_PASSWORD --ntp-pools cfntp-4-1.us.cray.com,cfntp-4-2.us.cray.com --can-external-dns 10.103.8.113 --can-gateway 10.103.8.1 --site-ip 172.30.56.2/24 --site-gw 172.30.48.1 --site-dns 172.30.84.40 --site-nic em1 --system-name odin --bgp-peers aggregation Automated Process For Mellanox there is a script mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py and for Aruba there is CANU (Cray Automated Network Utility). In order for these scripts to work the following commands will need to be applied on the switches.\nAruba   In order for the automated process to work, the following command will need to be run on the switches:\nsw-spine-001(config)# https-server rest access-mode read-write   Run CANU.\nCANU requires three parameters: the IP address of switch 1, the IP address of Switch 2, and the path to the directory containing the file sls_input_file.json.\nThe IP addresses in this example should be replaced by the IP addresses of the switches. Make sure the $SLS_PATH variable is set to the correct directory.\npit# SYSTEM_NAME=eniac pit# SLS_PATH=\u0026#34;/var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/\u0026#34; pit# canu -s 1.5 config bgp --ips 10.252.0.2,10.252.0.3 --csi-folder \u0026#34;${SLS_PATH}\u0026#34;   Mellanox   In order for the automated process to work, the following commands will need to be run on the switches:\nsw-spine-001 [standalone: master] \u0026gt; enable sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # configure terminal sw-spine-001 [standalone: master] (config) # json-gw enable   Run the BGP helper script.\nThe BGP helper script requires three parameters: the IP address of switch 1, the IP address of Switch 2, and the path to CSI-generated network files.\n The IP addresses used should be Node Management Network IP addresses (NMN). These IP addresses will be used for the BGP Router-ID. The path to the CSI-generated network files must include CAN.yaml, HMN.yaml, HMNLB.yaml, NMNLB.yaml, and NMN.yaml. The path must include the $SYSTEM_NAME.  The IP addresses in this example should be replaced by the IP addresses of the switches. Make sure the $CSI_PATH variable is set to the correct directory.\npit# SYSTEM_NAME=eniac pit# CSI_PATH=\u0026#34;/var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/networks/\u0026#34; pit# /usr/local/bin/mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py 10.252.0.2 10.252.0.3 \u0026#34;${CSI_PATH}\u0026#34; *WARNING* The mellanox_set_bgp_peers.py script assumes that the prefix length of the CAN is /24.

If it is early in the install process and the CSM services have not been deployed yet, there will not be speakers to peer with, so the peering sessions may not be ESTABLISHED yet. This is expected and not a problem.\nManual Process On the Aruba switches, the output of the show bgp ipv4 unicast summary command should look like the following if the MetalLB speaker pods are running. If it is early in the install process and the CSM services have not been deployed yet, you may see the neighbors in Idle, Active, or Connect state.

	"content": "External DNS External DNS, along with the Customer Access Network (CAN), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and MetalLB, makes it simpler to access the HPE Cray EX API and system management services. Services are accessible directly from a laptop without needing to tunnel into a non-compute node (NCN) or override /etc/hosts settings. Some services may require a JSON Web Token (JWT) to access them, while others may require Keycloak to login using a DC LDAP password.\nThe following services are currently available:\n HPE Cray EX API (requires valid JWT) Keycloak Ceph RADOS gateway (requires valid JWT) Nexus System Management Health Prometheus (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) System Management Health Grafana (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) System Management Health Alertmanager (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) Kiali, for Istio service mesh visibility (redirects to Keycloak for SSO) Jaeger, for Istio tracing (redirects to Keycloak for SSO)  In general, external hostnames should resolve to a CAN external IP address for the following services:\n istio-system/istio-ingressgateway-can - Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway. services/cray-keycloak-gatekeeper-ingress - Keycloak Gatekeeper\u0026rsquo;s ingress reverse proxy that redirects browsers to Keycloak for log in, and then to Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway with a valid JWT for authorized access.  This can be verified using the dig command to resolve the external hostname and compare it with Kubernetes.\nWhat Happens if External DNS is not Used? Without forwarding to External DNS, administrators will not have the ability to use the externally exposed services, such as Prometheus, Grafana, the HPE Cray EX REST API, and more. See Externally Exposed Services for more information.\nAccessing most of these services by IP address will not work because the Ingress Gateway uses the name to direct requests to the appropriate service.\nDNS for HPE Cray EX Systems There is a separate set of DNS instances within HPE Cray EX that is used by the nodes and pods within the system for resolving names.\n  Unbound\nThe unbound DNS instance is used to resolve names for the physical equipment on the management networks within HPE Cray EX, such as NCNs, UANs, switches, compute nodes, and more.

This instance is accessible only within the HPE Cray EX Kubernetes cluster.\n  Connect Customer DNS to External DNS The DNS instance at the customer site should use DNS forwarding to forward the subdomain specified by the system-name and site-domain values (combined to make the system-name.site-domain value) to the IP address specified by the can-external-dns value. These values are defined with the csi config init command.

	"content": "External DNS Failing to Discover Services Workaround Many external DNS issues can be worked around by directly connecting to the desired backend service. This can circumvent authentication and authorization protections, but it may be necessary to access specific services when mitigating critical issues.\nIstio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway uses Gateway and VirtualService objects to configure how traffic is routed to backend services. Currently, there is only one gateway supporting the Customer Access Network (CAN), which is services/services-gateway. It is configured to support traffic for any host. Consequently, it is the VirtualService objects that ultimately control routing based on hostname.\nUse this procedure to resolve any external DNS routing issues with backend services.\nPrerequisites This procedure requires administrative privileges.\nProcedure   Search for the VirtualService object that corresponds to the desired service.\nThe command below will list all external hostnames.\nncn-w001# kubectl get vs -A | grep -v \u0026#39;[*]\u0026#39; NAMESPACE NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE istio-system kiali [services/services-gateway] [kiali-istio.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h istio-system prometheus [services/services-gateway] [prometheus-istio.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h istio-system tracing [services/services-gateway] [jaeger-istio.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h nexus nexus [services/services-gateway] [packages.local registry.local nexus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h services gitea-vcs-external [services/services-gateway] [vcs.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h services sma-grafana [services-gateway] [sma-grafana.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h services sma-kibana [services-gateway] [sma-kibana.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-alertmanager [services/services-gateway] [alertmanager.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-grafana [services/services-gateway] [grafana.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus [services/services-gateway] [prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 2d16h   Inspect the VirtualService object(s) to learn the destination service and port.\nUse the NAME value returned in the previous step.

Also, notice that the VirtualService for prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME uses the existing services/services-gateway Gateway CRD and does not create a new one.\nSecure Ingress via Keycloak Gatekeeper Web apps intended to be accessed via the browser, such as Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Kiali, Jaeger, Kibana, Elasticsearch, should go through the Keycloak Gatekeeper reverse proxy. Browser sessions are automatically configured to use a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authorization to Istio\u0026rsquo;s ingress gateway, enabling a central enforcement point of Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for system management traffic.\nThe Keycloak Gatekeeper will inject HTTP headers so that an upstream endpoint can identify the user and customize access as needed. To enable ingress via Keycloak Gatekeeper external hostnames, web apps need to be added to the keycloak_gatekeeper_proxied_hosts Ansible variable.\n"

The healthy states are described below, as long as the write to the ConfigMap has not failed:\n No differences found. Skipping DNS update Differences found. Writing new DNS records to our configmap.  Troubleshooting: The Manager runs periodically, about every minute in release v1.4. Check if this is a one-time occurrence or if it is a recurring issue.\n If the error shows in one Manager log, but not during the next one, this is likely a one-time failure. Check to see if the record exists in DNS, and if so, move on. If several or all Manager logs show errors, particularly the same error, this could be of several sources:   Bad network connections to DHCP and/or SLS/SMD.\nACTION: Capture as much log data as possible and contact customer support.\n  Bad data from DHCP and/or SLS/SMD.\nACTION: If connections to DHCP (Kea) are involved, refer to Troubleshoot DHCP Issues.\n    Restart Unbound If any errors discovered in the sections above have been deemed transient or have not been resolved, the Unbound pods can be restarted.\nUse the following command to restart the pods:\n  Restart Unbound\nncn-w001# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment cray-dns-unbound   A rolling restart of the Unbound pods will occur, old pods will not be terminated and new pods will not be added to the load balancer until the new pods have successfully loaded the DNS records.\nClear Bad Data in the Unbound ConfigMap Unbound stores records it obtains from DHCP, SLS, and SMD via the Manager job in a ConfigMap. It is possible to clear this ConfigMap and allow the next Manager job to regenerate the content.\nThis is useful in the following cases:\n A transient failure in any Unbound process or required services has left the configuration data in a bad state. SLS and SMD data needed to be reset because of bad or incorrect data there. DHCP (Kea) has been restarted to clear errors.  The following clears the (DNS Helper) Manager generated data in the ConfigMap. This is generally safe as Unbound runtime data is held elsewhere.\nncn-w001# kubectl -n services patch configmaps cray-dns-unbound \\ --type merge -p \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;binaryData\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;records.json.gz\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;H4sICLQ/Z2AAA3JlY29yZHMuanNvbgCLjuUCAETSaHADAAAA\u0026#34;}}\u0026#39; "

In the example below, these two p2p subnets are 10.11.15.148/30 and 10.101.15.152/30. The subnets used are up to the customer.\nThere are two routes configured on the customer\u0026rsquo;s switch to route traffic for the CAN subnet to each of the spine switches. ECMP will load balance the traffic across each of the switches when both links are up and only use the active link when one of the links goes down.\nThe CAN is connected between each spine switch and the NCNs through vlan 7 running over the physical connections between the spines and the port on the NCN. This is the same physical connection used for the NMN and HMN on the NCNs.\nThe two physical connections between the NCN and spines is MLAGed. MAGP/VSX is used to provide a single virtual router gateway that can be used as the default route on each of the NCNs.\nThis is an example of the p2p configuration on the spine switches. The IP address should be replaced with the IP address chosen by the customer matching the customer\u0026rsquo;s switch configuration.\n  Mellanox:\ninterface ethernet 1/11 speed auto force interface ethernet 1/11 description to-can interface ethernet 1/11 no switchport force interface ethernet 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.150/30 primary   Aruba:\ninterface 1/1/36 no shutdown description to-can ip address 10.101.15.150/30 exit   There must then be two routes on the customer\u0026rsquo;s switch directing traffic for the customer_access_network subnet to the endpoint on the spine switch.\nThe following is an example of the route configuration on the customer switch.

	"content": "Troubleshoot Common DNS Issues The Domain Name Service (DNS) is part of an integrated infrastructure set designed to provide dynamic host discovery, addressing, and naming. There are several different place to look for troubleshooting as DNS interacts with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the Hardware Management Service (HMS), the System Layout Service (SLS), and the State Manager Daemon (SMD).\nThe information below describes what to check when experiencing issues with DNS.\nTroubleshoot an invalid hostname It is important to verify if a hostname is correct. The values in the networks.yml or networks_derived.yml files are sometimes inaccurate.\nThe formats show below are valid hostnames:\n Component names (xnames)  Node Management Network (NMN):  \u0026lt;xname\\\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xname\\\u0026gt;.local   Hardware Management Network (HMN):  \u0026lt;xname\\\u0026gt;-mgmt \u0026lt;xname\\\u0026gt;-mgmt.local     NID  Node Management Network (NMN):  nid\u0026lt;nid\\_number\\\u0026gt;-nmn nid\u0026lt;nid\\_number\\\u0026gt;-nmn.local      Additional steps are needed if a hostname or component name (xname) is either listed incorrectly or not listed at all in the networks.yml or networks_derived.yml files. In that case, the following actions must be taken:\n Update the hostname in the Hardware State Manager (HSM). Re-run any Ansible plays that require the data in these files.  Check if a host is in DNS Use the dig or nslookup commands directly against the Unbound resolver. A host is correctly in DNS if the response from the dig command includes the following:\n The ANSWER SECTION value exists with a valid hostname and IP address.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "CAN with Dual-Spine Configuration The Customer Access Network (CAN) needs to be connected to both spines in a dual-spine configuration so that each spine can access the outside network. However, the NCNs should only have one default gateway. Therefore, the multi-active gateway protocol (MAGP) on the Mellanox spines can be used to create a virtual router gateway IP address that can direct to either of the spines, depending on the state of the spines. The Virtual Switching Extension (VSX) for Aruba spines serve the same purpose.\nFor more information:\n Mellanox: https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/howto-configure-magp-on-mellanox-switches Aruba: https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.04/HTML/5200-6728/index.html#book.html  The following is an example of the point-to-point configuration on the spine switches. The IP address should be replaced with the IP address chosen by the customer that matches the switch configuration.\n  Mellanox:\ninterface ethernet 1/11 speed auto force interface ethernet 1/11 description to-can interface ethernet 1/11 no switchport force interface ethernet 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.150/30 primary   Aruba:\ninterface 1/1/36 no shutdown description to-can ip address 10.101.15.150/30 exit   There must then be two routes on the customer\u0026rsquo;s switch directing traffic for the customer_access_network subnet to the endpoint on the spine switch. The following is an example of the route configuration on the customer switch. These addresses and subnets are generated from CSI and can be found in the CAN.yaml file.\n- full_name: CAN Bootstrap DHCP Subnet cidr: ip: 10.101.8.0 mask: - 255 - 255 - 255 - 0 There must be a default route on each spine switch that will direct traffic that does not match other routes to the endpoint on the customer switch. The following examples are for the route configuration on sw-spine-001.\n  Mellanox:\nip route vrf default 0.0.0.0/0 10.101.15.149   Aruba:\nip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.101.15.149   The spine switch must also have the customer_access_gateway IP address assigned to the vlan 7 interface on the switch. This provides a gateway for the default route on the NCNs and UANs, as well as a direct route to the customer_access_network from the spine switch. For example:\n  Mellanox:\ninterface vlan 7 ip address 10.101.8.2/26 primary   Aruba:\nsw-spine-002(config)# int vlan 7 sw-spine-002(config-if-vlan)# ip address 10.102.11.3/24   Distribution Spine/Switch Connection The connection between the distribution switch and the spines require two separate uplinks from the spine switch to the distribution switch. Two static routes need to be created on the distribution switch to route the CAN subnet to each of the spine switches. These routes will have equal cost (ECMP) to split the load across the two spines and provide redundancy if one of the spines should go down.\ninterface 1/1/41 no shutdown description WASP spine-001 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.149/30 interface 1/1/42 no shutdown description WASP spine-002 1/11 ip address 10.101.15.153/30 ip route 10.102.5/26 10.101.15.150 ip route 10.102.5/26 10.101.15.154 NCN/Spine Connection Each of the NCNs has a connection to each spine. These ports on the NCN will be configured as bonded. The spine ports on the other end of these connections will be configured as a multi-chassis link aggregation group (MLAG) port channel.\nThe NCN will also need to configure a default route pointing to a gateway IP address on the CAN. In a dual-spine configuration, this will continue to use the IP address specified in the can-gateway value. The main difference in the dual-spine configuration is that this IP address will now be a virtual IP address on the spine switches rather than the vlan 7 IP address. This virtual IP address is part of MAGP configuration. Each spine will have an IP address on its vlan 7 interface that is not the can-gateway IP address.\nThen the following MAGP configuration will be added (same configuration on each of the spines):\n virtual-router address = can-gateway virtual-router mac-address = 00:00:5E:00:01:07.  The MAC used here follows RFC 3768 Section 7.3 in the external documentation.    MAGP on the spine:\nprotocol magp interface vlan 7 magp 7 interface vlan 7 magp 7 ip virtual-router address 10.102.5.57 interface vlan 7 magp 7 ip virtual-router mac-address 00:00:5E:00:01:07 Vlan 7 on the spine:\ninterface vlan 7 ip address 10.102.5.1/26 primary In the example above, spine-001 is showed.\nDefault route on the NCN (configured by the can-network role):\nncn-m001# ip route default via 10.102.5.27 dev vlan007 "

	"content": "Connect to the CAN How to connect to the CAN physically and via layer 3.\nThere are multiple ways to connect to the Customer Access Network (CAN), both physically and via a layer 3 connection.\nPhysical Connection to the CAN The physical connection to the CAN is made via the load balancer or the spine switches. The uplink connection from the system to the customer network is achieved by using the highest numbered port(s). Customer can select a single uplink port or multiple uplink ports.\nIn the example below, a Mellanox SN2700 with a single uplink connection is being used. The cable would connect to port 32 as shown in the diagram below:\nLayer 3 Connection to the CAN The CAN clients in the system require a routing topology that is setup to route traffic to the customer network. This can be done in a variety of ways and will vary depending on the system setup and configuration. The different options for connecting to the CAN from layer 3 are described below.\nOption 1: Point-to-Point\nThis option provides a point-to-point routing topology between the customer switch and the HPE Cray EX TOR Spine Switch. See CAN with Dual-Spine Configuration for more information on using this topology for a dual-spine configuration.\nThe diagram below shows how the point-to-point routing topology works:\nOption 2: Single Gateway\nThe single gateway options requires the customer to provide an IP address that is on a /24 network. This IP address will act as the gateway for traffic bound to the HPE Cray EX CAN.\nFor example, a customer could use the 192.168.30.0/24 network to connect via the HPE Cray EX CAN uplink connection. The customer also needs to provide an IP address on this network, such as 192.168.30.253. This IP address will be assigned to the uplink port on the HPE Cray EX TOR Spine Switch.\nFor a dual-spine configuration, the admin would need to extended the customer network to both switches using one IP address for each switch. After extending the network, two equal routes need to be configured. The spine switches are configured to support multi-chassis link aggregation group (MLAG) from NCNs and UANs. These nodes are configured for bonding mode layer 2 and layer 3. See CAN with Dual-Spine Configuration for more information.\nThe diagram below shows how the connection is established:\nOption 3: Customer Specific\nThe system can be setup using other customer requirements. In order to do so, the following information will be needed:\n   Item Description     Customer network IP address Specifies an IP address on the customer network that is routable to the customer network gateway   CAN IP address space Specifies a dedicated network (typically /24) that is routable from the customer network to be used for the CAN   System name Specifies the system name to be used and configured   Domain namespace extension Specifies the domain extension to be used; for example, HPE Cray EX.customer.com   Customer network IP address for ncn-m001 Specifies an IP address for administrative access on the customer network for ncn-m001   (Optional) BMC customer network IP address for ncn-m001 Specifies an IP address for BMC access on the customer network for ncn-m001    "

	"content": "Customer Access Network The Customer Access Network (CAN) provides access from outside the customer network to services, non-compute nodes (NCNs), and User Access Nodes (UANs) in the system. This allows for the following:\n Clients outside of the system:  Log in to each of the NCNs and UANs. Access web UIs within the system (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, and more). Access the Rest APIs within the system. Access a DNS server within the system for resolution of names for the webUI and REST API services. Run Cray CLI commands from outside the system. Access the User Access Instances (UAI).   NCNs and UANs to access systems outside the cluster (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more). Services within the cluster to access systems outside the cluster.  These nodes and services need an IP address that routes to the customer\u0026rsquo;s network in order to be accessed from outside the network.\nImplications if CAN is not Configured  No direct access to the NCNs other than ncn-m001. Will need to hop through ncn-m001 to get to the rest of the NCNs. No direct access to the UANs unless the UAN has a direct connection to the customer network. NCNs other than ncn-m001 do not have access to services outside of the system (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more).  These nodes will not have an interface on any network with access outside of the HPE Cray EX system. These nodes will not have a default route. This includes access to any of the externally exposed services from these nodes.   Pods running on NCNs other than ncn-m001 will not have access to services outside of the system. No access to externally exposed services. See Externally Exposed Services for more information.  CAN Subnets IP addresses are allocated from a single IP subnet that is configured as the can-cidr value in the csi config init input. This subnet is further divided into three smaller subnets:\n Subnet for NCNs, UANs, and switches. Subnet for the MetalLB static pool (can-static-pool).  This is used for services that need to be pinned to the same IP address. For example, the external DNS service that needs to be configured in the upstream DNS server. This subnet currently needs only a few IP addresses.   Subnet for the MetalLB dynamic pool (can-dynamic-pool).  This is the largest subnet because it is used for most of the other services, which includes UAIs. These IP addresses can be allocated differently across deployments because these services are accessed by DNS name rather than by IP. The size of this subnet depends on how many UAI and Image Management Service (IMS) pods are needed at a given time because these IP addresses will come out of this subnet.    The minimum size for the CAN subnet is /26. The CAN /26 subnet allows for the following:\n  27 IP addresses for the NCNs, UANs, and Switches.\n  4 IP addresses for the CAN static service IP addresses.\n  32 IP addresses for the rest of the external CAN services.\nThe 32 service IP addresses will be used for the 5 standard customer-access service IP addresses and the remaining 27 IP addresses are for UAI and/or IMS services.\n  If there are more than 27 IP addresses needed for NCNs, UANs, and switches, and/or more than 32 IP addresses needed for the external CAN services, then the CAN subnet will need to be larger than a /26.\nCustomer Variables The following variables are defined in the csi config init input. This example uses values for the /26 layout described above. The can-gateway value should be an IP address at the end of the range for NCNs, UANs, and switches. For example, the IP address would be 10.102.5.27 using the figure shown above.\nlinux# csi config init . . . --can-cidr 10.102.5.0/26 --can-gateway 10.102.5.27 --can-static-pool 10.102.5.28/30 --can-dynamic-pool 10.102.5.32/27 --can-external-dns 10.102.5.29 --system-name testsystem --site-domain example.com . . .

The following are the available internal and external networks, as well as the devices that connect to each network:\n Networks external to the system:  Customer Network (Data Center)  ncn-m001 BMC is connected by the customer network switch to the customer management network All NCNs (worker, master, and storage) are connected ClusterStor System Management Unit (SMU) interfaces User Access Nodes (UANs)     System networks:  Customer Network (Data Center)  ncn-m001 BMC is connected by the customer network switch to the customer management network ClusterStor SMU interfaces User Access Nodes (UANs)   Hardware Management Network (HMN)  BMCs for Admin tasks Power distribution units (PDU) Keyboard/video/mouse (KVM)   Node Management Network (NMN)  All NCNs and compute nodes User Access Nodes (UANs)   ClusterStor Management Network  ClusterStor controller management interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, Metadata Management Unit (MMU), and Scalable Storage Unit (SSU))   High-Speed Network (HSN), which connects the following devices:  Kubernetes worker nodes UANs ClusterStor controller data interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, MMU, and SSU) There must be at least two NCNs whose BMCs are on the HMN. If these are not present, there cannot be multiple DVS servers that function correctly, which will have an effect on compute node root file system and PE scaling/performance/reliability.      During initial installation, several of those networks are created with default IP address ranges. See Default IP Address Ranges.\nA default configuration of Access Control Lists (ACL) is also set when the system is installed. The default configuration of ACLs between the NMN and HMN are described below:\nMountain NMN to HMN Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn bind point rif Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn seq-number 10 deny ip 10.100.0.0 mask 255.252.0.0 10.104.0.0 mask 255.252.0.0 Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn seq-number 20 deny ip 10.100.0.0 mask 255.252.0.0 10.254.0.0 mask 255.255.128.0 Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn seq-number 30 permit ip any any Interface vlan 2000 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn Interface vlan 2001 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn Interface vlan 2002 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn Interface vlan 2003 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-nmn-to-hmn Mountain HMN to NMN Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn bind point rif Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn seq number 10 deny 10.104.0.0 mask 255.252.0.0 10.100.0.0 mask 255.252.0.0 Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn seq number 20 deny 10.104.0.0 mask 255.252.0.0 10.252.0.0 mask 255.255.128.0 Ipv4 access-list deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn seq number 30 permit ip any any Interface vlan 3000 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn Interface vlan 3001 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn Interface vlan 3002 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn Interface vlan 3003 ipv4 port access-group deny-mtn-hmn-to-nmn The network management system (NMS) data model and REST API enable customer sites to construct their own \u0026ldquo;networks\u0026rdquo; of nodes within the high-speed fabric, where a \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo; is a collection of nodes that share a VLAN and an IP subnet.\nThe low-level network management components (switch, DHCP service, ARP service) of the NCNs and ClusterStor interfaces are configured to serve one particular network (the \u0026ldquo;supported network\u0026rdquo;) on the high-speed fabric. The supported network includes all of the compute nodes, thereby enabling those compute nodes to access the gateway, user access services, and ClusterStor devices. A site may create other networks as well, but it is only the supported network that is served by those devices.\n"

	"content": "Required Labels if CAN is Not Configured Some services on the system are required to access services outside of the HPE Cray EX system. If the Customer Access Network (CAN) is not configured on the system, these services will need to be pinned to ncn-m001 because that is the only node that has external access. See Customer Access Network (CAN) for more implications if CAN is not configured.\nThe label used for scheduling these services is no_external_access:\n If the no_external_access label is applied to a node with the value True, then any pods that require outside access will not be scheduled on that node. If the no_external_access label is applied to a node with the value False, or if the label does not exist on the node, then any pods that require outside access will be scheduled on that node.  Therefore, if CAN is not configured on the system, the label no_external_access=True must be applied to all NCN master and worker nodes other than ncn-m001.\nBefore Installation The label can be configured by setting the following values to True in the customizations.yaml file. This value needs to be set for each NCN master and worker node, excluding ncn-m001.\ncray-node-labels: nodeLabels: - ncn-m001:no_external_access=False - ncn-m002:no_external_access=True - ncn-m003:no_external_access=True - ncn-w001:no_external_access=False - ncn-w002:no_external_access=False - ncn-w003:no_external_access=False Post-Installation The label can be set by editing the Kubernetes ConfigMap by running the following command:\nncn-m001# kubectl edit cm -n services cray-node-labels Edit the following section as desired (save and close by hitting the ESC key and typing :wq):\nnode_labels: |2- - ncn-m001:no_external_access=False - ncn-m002:no_external_access=True - ncn-m003:no_external_access=True - ncn-w001:no_external_access=False - ncn-w002:no_external_access=False - ncn-w003:no_external_access=False To view the labels applied to each node:\nncn-m001# kubectl get nodes --show-labels "

	"content": "Troubleshoot CAN Issues Various connection points to check when using the CAN and how to fix any issues that arise.\nThe most frequent issue with the Customer Access Network (CAN) is trouble accessing IP addresses outside of the HPE Cray EX system from a node or pod inside the system.\nThe best way to resolve this issue is to try to ping an outside IP address from one of the NCNs other than ncn-m001, which has a direct connection that it can use instead of the Customer Access Network (CAN). The following are some things to check to make sure CAN is configured correctly:\nDoes the NCN have an IP Address Configured on the vlan007 Interface? Check the status of the vlan007 interface. Make sure it has an address specified.\nncn-w002# ip addr show vlan007 534: vlan007@bond0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 98:03:9b:b4:27:62 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 10.102.5.5/26 brd 10.101.8.255 scope global vlan007 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::9a03:9bff:feb4:2762/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever If there is not an address specified, make sure the can- values have been defined in csi config init input.\nDoes the NCN have a Default Gateway Configured? Check the default route on an NCN other than ncn-m001. There should be a default route with a gateway matching the can-gateway value.\nncn-w002# ip route | grep default default via 10.102.5.27 dev vlan007 If there is not an address specified, make sure the can- values have been defined in csi config init input.\nCan the Node Reach the Default CAN Gateway? Check that the node can ping the default gateway shown in the default route.\nncn-w002# ping 10.102.5.27 PING 10.102.5.27 (10.102.5.27) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.148 ms 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.107 ms 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.133 ms 64 bytes from 10.102.5.27: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.122 ms ^C --- 10.102.5.27 ping statistics --- 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3053ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.107/0.127/0.148/0.018 ms If the default gateway cannot be accessed, check the spine switch configuration.\nCan the Spines Reach Outside of the System? Check that each of the spines can ping an IP address outside of the HPE Cray EX system. This must be an IP address that is reachable from the network to which the CAN is connected. If there is only one spine being used on the system, only spine-001 needs to be checked.\nsw-spine-001 [standalone: master] # ping 8.8.8.8 PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=112 time=12.6 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=112 time=12.5 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=112 time=22.4 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=112 time=12.5 ms ^C --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics --- 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 12.501/15.022/22.440/4.285 ms If the outside IP address cannot be reached, check the spine switch configuration and the connection to the customer network.\nCan the Spines Reach the NCN?

	"content": "Pod Resource Limits Kubernetes uses resource requests and Quality of Service (QoS) for scheduling pods. Resource requests can be provided explicitly for pods and containers, whereas pod QoS is implicit, based on the resource requests and limits of the containers in the pod. There are three types of QoS:\n Guaranteed: All containers in a pod have explicit memory and CPU resource requests and limits. For each resource, the limit equals the request. Burstable: Does not meet Guaranteed requirements, but some of the containers have explicit memory and CPU resource requests or limits. BestEffort: None of the containers specify any resources.  Kubernetes will best be able to schedule pods when there are resources associated with each container in each pod.\nResource Limits For systems, all containers should have explicit resource requests and limits. Most pods should fall into the Burstable category. Containers that have resource requests equal to the resource limits should be reserved for very well behaved containers, and will usually be simple, single-function containers. One example of this could be an init container that is waiting for another resource to become available.\nResource limits are set by default at the namespace level, but pods within that namespace can increase or decrease their limits depending on the nature of the workload.\n"

This procedure includes examples for rebuilding etcd clusters in the services namespace. This procedure must be used for each unhealthy cluster, not just the services used in the following examples.\nThis process also applies when etcd is not visible when running the kubectl get pods command.\nA special use case is also included for the Content Projection Service (CPS) as the process for rebuilding the cluster is slightly different.\nPrerequisites An etcd cluster has pods that are not healthy, or the etcd cluster has no pods. See Check the Health and Balance of etcd Clusters for more information.\nClusters in the Services Namespace The following examples use the cray-bos etcd cluster, but these steps must be repeated for every unhealthy service.\n  Retrieve the .yaml file for the deployment and the etcd cluster objects.\nncn-w001# kubectl -n services get deployment cray-bos -o yaml \u0026gt; /root/etcd/cray-bos.yaml ncn-w001# kubectl -n services get etcd cray-bos-etcd -o yaml \u0026gt; /root/etcd/cray-bos-etcd.yaml Only two files must be retrieved in most cases.

The IP address is created automatically via a cronjob that runs at the top of each hour.\n  Determine the periodic backup name for the cluster.\nThe following example is for the bos cluster:\nncn-w001# kubectl get etcdbackup -n services | grep bos.*periodic cray-bos-etcd-cluster-periodic-backup   Delete the etcd backup definition.\nA new backup will be created that points to the new IP address. Use the value returned in the previous substep.\nncn-w001# kubectl delete etcdbackup -n services \\ cray-bos-etcd-cluster-periodic-backup     Rerun the etcd cluster health check (see Check the Health and Balance of etcd Clusters) after recovering one or more clusters. Ensure that the clusters are healthy and have the correct number of pods.\n"

	"content": "Repopulate Data in etcd Clusters When Rebuilding Them When an etcd cluster is not healthy, it needs to be rebuilt. During that process, the pods that rely on etcd clusters lose data. That data needs to be repopulated in order for the cluster to go back to a healthy state.\nThe following services need their data repopulated in the etcd cluster:\n Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) Boot Script Service (BSS) Content Projection Service (CPS) Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) External DNS Firmware Action Service (FAS) HMS Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS)  Prerequisites An etcd cluster was rebuilt. See Rebuild Unhealthy etcd Clusters.\nBOS   Reconstruct boot session templates for impacted product streams to repopulate data.\nBoot preparation information for other product streams can be found in the following locations:\n UANs: Refer to the UAN product stream repository and search for the \u0026ldquo;PREPARE UAN BOOT SESSION TEMPLATES\u0026rdquo; header in the \u0026ldquo;Install and Configure UANs\u0026rdquo; procedure. Cray Operating System (COS): Refer to the \u0026ldquo;Create a Boot Session Template\u0026rdquo; header in the \u0026ldquo;Boot COS\u0026rdquo; procedure in the COS product stream documentation.    CPS   Repopulate clusters for CPS.\n If there are no clients using CPS when the etcd cluster is rebuilt, then nothing needs to be done other than to rebuild the cluster and make sure all of the components are up and running. See Rebuild Unhealthy etcd Clusters for more information. If any clients have already mounted content provided by CPS, that content should be unmounted before rebuilding the etcd cluster, and then re-mounted after the etcd cluster is rebuilt. Compute nodes that use CPS to access their root file system must be shut down to unmount, and then booted to perform the re-mount.    CRUS Note: CRUS is deprecated in CSM 1.2.0.

This procedure shows how to restore the bare-metal etcd cluster from an Simple Storage Service (S3) snapshot.\nThe etcd cluster needs to be restored from a backup when the Kubernetes cluster and master nodes are being rebuilt.\nPrerequisites The Kubernetes cluster on master nodes is being rebuilt.\nProcedure   Retrieve the S3 credentials for the Etcd-Backup user.\nThe following command must be run from a storage node.\nncn# radosgw-admin user info --uid Etcd-Backup | jq -r \u0026#39;.keys\u0026#39; [ { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Etcd-Backup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;access_key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;value\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secret_key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;value\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } ] Note the returned access_key and secret_key values.\n  Configure the S3 client credentials.\nThe first NCN master node in a deployment contains a couple of helper scripts related to backup and restore. Use the values from the previous step to update the credentials.json file in the /opt/cray/platform/utils/s3 directory.\nncn# cd /opt/cray/platform-utils/s3 ncn# vim credentials.json { \u0026#34;access_key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;value\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secret_key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;value\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;endpoint_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://rgw-vip\u0026#34; }   Select a snapshot to restore a backup.\nThe following command lists the available backups.

If replication lag is not caught early, it can cause the disk mounted on /home/postgres/pgdata to fill up and the database to stop running. If this issue is caught before the database stops, it can be easily remediated using a patronictl command to reinitialize the lagging cluster member.\nCheck if replication is working When services have a Postgres cluster of pods, they need to be able to replicate data between them. When the pods are not able to replicate data, the database will become full. The patronictl list command will show the status of replication.\nReplication is working The following is an example where replication is working:\nncn-mw# kubectl exec keycloak-postgres-0 -c postgres -n services -it -- patronictl list Example output:\n+-------------------+---------------------+------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ | Cluster | Member | Host | Role | State | TL | Lag in MB | +-------------------+---------------------+------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-0 | 10.40.0.23 | Leader | running | 1 | | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-1 | 10.42.0.25 | | running | 1 | 0 | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-2 | 10.42.0.29 | | running | 1 | 0 | +-------------------+---------------------+------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ Replication is not working The following is an example where replication is broken:\n+-------------------+---------------------+--------------+--------+----------+----+-----------+ | Cluster | Member | Host | Role | State | TL | Lag in MB | +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+--------+----------+----+-----------+ | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-0 | 10.42.10.22 | | starting | | unknown | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-1 | 10.40.11.191 | Leader | running | 47 | | | keycloak-postgres | keycloak-postgres-2 | 10.40.11.190 | | running | 14 | 608 | +-------------------+---------------------+--------------+--------+----------+----+-----------+ Recover replication In the event that a state of broken Postgres replication persists and the space allocated for the WAL files fills up, the affected database will likely shut down and create a state where it can be very difficult to recover. This can impact the reliability of the related service and may require that it be redeployed with data repopulation procedures. If replication lag is caught and remediated before the database shuts down, replication can be recovered using patronictl reinit.\nA reinitialize will get the lagging replica member re-synced and replicating again. This should be done as soon as replication lag is detected. In the preceding example, keycloak-postgres-0 and keycloak-postgres-2 were not replicating properly (unknown or non-zero lag). To remediate, kubectl exec into the leader pod and use patronictl reinit \u0026lt;cluster\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lagging cluster member\u0026gt; to reinitialize the lagging member(s).\nFor example:\n  Reinitialize the first lagging replica member.\nncn-mw# kubectl exec keycloak-postgres-1 -n services -it -- bash root@keycloak-postgres-1:/home/postgres# patronictl reinit keycloak-postgres keycloak-postgres-0 Example output:\nAre you sure you want to reinitialize members keycloak-postgres-0?

It is used to run containers on the Kubernetes platform.\n/var/lib/containerd filling up In older versions of containerd, there are cases where the /var/lib/containerd directory fills up.

See notes below for subsequent steps that must be taken after containerd is restarted (independent of disk space issues).\n  Restart kubelet on the NCN:\nncn-w001 # systemctl restart kubelet If restarting kubelet fails to free up space in /var/lib/containerd, proceed to Step 3.\n  Prune unused container images on the NCN:\nncn-w001 # crictl rmi --prune Any unused images will be pruned. Finally, if still encountering disk space issues in /var/lib/containerd, proceed to the next step to reboot the NCN.\n  Reboot the NCN:\nFollow the Reboot_NCNs process to properly cordon/drain the NCN and reboot.

As a result, the system\u0026rsquo;s micro-services are modular, resilient, and can be updated independently. Services within this architecture communicate via REST APIs.\nAbout Kubernetes Kubernetes is a portable and extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes serves as a micro-services platform on the system that facilitates application deployment, scaling, and management. The system uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.\nResiliency The resiliency feature of Kubernetes ensures that the desired number of deployments of a micro-service are always running on one or more NCNs. In addition, Kubernetes ensures that if one NCN becomes unresponsive, the micro-services that were running on it are migrated to another NCN that is up and meets the requirements of the micro-services.\nKubernetes Components Kubernetes components can be divided into:\n Master components - Kubernetes master components provide the cluster\u0026rsquo;s control plane. These components make global decisions about the cluster, such as scheduling, and responding to cluster events. Worker components - A Kubernetes worker is a node that provides services necessary to run application containers. It is managed by the Kubernetes master. Node components run on every node and keep pods running, while providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.  An etcd cluster is used for storage and state management of the Kubernetes cluster.\n"

This gateway can be accessed using a URL in the following format:\nhttps://api.SYSTEM-NAME_DOMAIN-NAME The API requests then get routed to the appropriate node running that service.\nAccess services from within the cluster All services running inside the cluster can access each other using their Pod IP address or the service\u0026rsquo;s cluster IP address, along with the service\u0026rsquo;s exposed port. The exception to this is a service that has a Cray REST API.

Failures in the etcd cluster at the heart of Kubernetes will cause a failure of Kubernetes. To mitigate this risk, the system is deployed with etcd on dedicated disks and with a specific configuration to optimize Kubernetes workloads. The system also provides additional etcd cluster(s) as necessary to help maintain an operational state of services. These additional clusters are managed by a Kubernetes operator and do not interact with the core Kubernetes etcd service.\nTo learn more about etcd, refer to the following links:\n General documentation - https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd README - https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/etcdctl etcd upstream performance - https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/performance.md#benchmarks  Usage of etcd on the System Communication between etcd machines is handled via the Raft consensus algorithm. Latency from the etcd leader is the most important metric to track because severe latency will introduce instability within the cluster. Raft is only as fast as the slowest machine in the majority. This problem can be mitigated by properly tuning the cluster.\netcd is a highly available key value store that runs on the three non-compute nodes (NCNs) that act as Kubernetes worker nodes. The three node cluster size deployment is used to meet the minimum requirements for resiliency. Scaling to more nodes will provide more resiliency, but it will not provide more speed. For example, one write to the cluster is actually three writes, so one to each instance. Scaling to five or more instances in a cluster would mean that one write will actually equal five writes to the cluster.\nThe system utilizes etcd in two major ways:\n etcd running on bare-metal with a dedicated disk partition  Supports only Kubernetes Includes a dedicated partition to provide the best throughput and scalability  Enables the Kubernetes services to be scaled, as well as the physical nodes running those services   Run on the Kubernetes master nodes and will not relocate  Handles replication and instance re-election in the event of a node failure   Backed up to a Ceph Rados Gateway (S3 compatible) bucket   etcd running via a Kubernetes operator  Services utilize this to deploy an etcd cluster on the worker nodes The etcd pods are mobile and will relocate in the event of a pod or node failure Each etcd cluster can be backed up to a Ceph Rados Gateway (S3 compatible) bucket  This option is decided by the service owner or developer as some information has an extremely short lifespan, and by the time the restore could be performed, the data would be invalid      "

On the other hand, Kubernetes taints enable a node to repel a set of pods. In addition, pods can have tolerances for taints to allow them to run on nodes with certain taints.\nTaints are controlled with the kubectl taint nodes command, while node labels for various nodes can be customized with a configmap that contains the desired values. For a description of how to modify the default node labels, refer to the Customer Access Network (CAN) documentation.\nThe list of existing labels can be retrieved using the following command:\nncn# kubectl get nodes --show-labels To learn more, refer to https://kubernetes.io/.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Customize an Image Root Using IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) customization workflow sets up a temporary image customization environment within a Kubernetes pod and mounts the image to be customized in that environment. A system administrator then makes the desired changes to the image root within the customization environment.\nAfterwards, the IMS customization workflow automatically copies the NCN CA public key to /etc/cray/ca/certificate_authority.crt within the image root being customized, in order to enable secure communications between NCNs and client nodes. IMS then compresses the customized image root and uploads it and its associated initrd image and kernel image (needed to boot a node) to the artifact repository.\nPrerequisites  System management services (SMS) are running in a Kubernetes cluster on non-compute nodes (NCN) and include the following deployments:  cray-ims, the Image Management Service (IMS) cray-nexus, the Nexus repository manager service   kubectl is installed locally and configured to point at the SMS Kubernetes cluster. An IMS registered image root archive or a pre-built image root SquashFS archive is available to customize. The NCN Certificate Authority (CA) public key has been properly installed into the CA cache for this system. A token providing Simple Storage Service (S3) credentials has been generated. When customizing an image using IMS Image Customization, once inside the image root using chroot (if using a `jailed` environment), the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains. In order to talk to services, including Nexus RPM repositories, the image root must first be configured with DNS and other settings. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to enable DNS resolution.  Limitations  The commands in this procedure must be run as the root user. Currently, the initrd image and kernel image are not regenerated automatically when the image root is changed. The admin must manually regenerate them while in the customization environment, if needed. Images in the .txz compressed format need to be converted to SquashFS in order to use IMS image customization.  Procedure   Check for an existing IMS public key.\n If it is known that a public key associated with the user account being used was not previously uploaded to the IMS service, then skip this step and proceed to upload the SSH public key to the IMS service.\n The following query may return multiple public key records. The correct one will have a name value including the current username in use.\nncn# cray ims public-keys list Example output excerpt:\n[[results]] public_key = \u0026#34;ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EA ...

Otherwise, if a public key associated with the username does exist, then note the value of its id field and proceed to record the IMS public key ID.    Upload the SSH public key to the IMS service.\n If an IMS public key record has already been created for the account being used, then note the value of its id field and proceed to record the IMS public key ID.\n The IMS debug/configuration shell relies on passwordless SSH. This SSH public key needs to be uploaded to IMS to enable interaction with the image customization environment later in this procedure.\nReplace the username value with the actual username being used on the system when setting the public key name.\nncn# cray ims public-keys create --name \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Example output:\npublic_key = \u0026#34;ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCl50gK4l9uupxC2KHxMpTNxPTJbnwEdWy1jst5W5LqJx9fdTrc9uNJ33HAq+WIOhPVGbLm2N4GX1WTUQ4+wVOSmmBBJnlu/l5rmO9lEGT6U8lKG8dA9c7qhguGHy7M7WBgdW/gWA16gwE/u8Qc2fycFERRKmFucL/Er9wA0/Qvz7/U59yO+HOtk5hvEz/AUkvaaoY0IVBfdNBCl59CIdZHxDzgXlXzd9PAlrXZNO8jDD3jyFAOvMMRG7py78zj2NUngvsWYoBcV3FcREZJU529uJ0Au8Vn9DRADyB4QQS2o+fa6hG9i2SzfY8L6vAVvSE7A2ILAsVruw1Zeiec2IWt\u0026#34; id = \u0026#34;a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; created = \u0026#34;2018-11-21T17:19:07.830000+00:00\u0026#34; Note the value of the id field and proceed to record the IMS public key ID.\n  Record the IMS public key ID.\nCreate a variable for the IMS public key id value noted previously.\nncn# IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID=a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e   Determine if the image root being used is in IMS and ready to be customized.\n If the image to be customized is already known to IMS, then proceed to Locate an IMS Image to Customize.

Unfortunately, IMS is not able to dynamically determine the names of the Linux kernel and initrd to look for, because the file name for these vary depending upon Linux distribution, Linux version, dracut configuration, and more. Therefore the user must pass into IMS the name of the kernel and initrd in the resultant image root\u0026rsquo;s /boot directory.\nUse the following table to help determine the default kernel and initrd file names to specify when submitting the job to customize an image. These are just default names. Consult with the site administrator to determine if these names have been changed for a given image or recipe.\n   Recipe Recipe Name Kernel File Name initrd File Name     SLES 15 SP3 Barebones cray-sles15sp3-barebones vmlinuz initrd   COS cray-shasta-compute-sles15sp3.x86_64-1.4.66 vmlinuz initrd     Under normal circumstances, IMS customization jobs will download and mount the rootfs for the specified IMS image under the /mnt/image/image-root directory within the SSH shell. After SSHing into the job container, cd or chroot into the /mnt/image/image-root directory in order to interact with the image root being customized.\nOptionally, IMS can be told to create a jailed SSH environment by specifying the --ssh-containers-jail True parameter.\nA jailed environment lets users SSH into the SSH container and be immediately within the image root for the image being customized. Users do not need to cd or chroot into the image root. Using a jailed environment has some advantages, such as making the IMS SSH job shell look more like a compute node. This allows applications like the CFS to perform actions on both IMS job pods (pre-boot) and compute nodes (post-boot).\nBefore running the following command, replace the MY_CUSTOMIZED_IMAGE value with the name of the image root being used.\n ncn# cray ims jobs create \\  --job-type customize \\  --kernel-file-name vmlinuz \\  --initrd-file-name initrd \\  --artifact-id $IMS_IMAGE_ID \\  --public-key-id $IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID \\  --enable-debug False \\  --image-root-archive-name MY_CUSTOMIZED_IMAGE Example output:\nstatus = \u0026#34;creating\u0026#34; enable_debug = false kernel_file_name = \u0026#34;vmlinuz\u0026#34; artifact_id = \u0026#34;4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19\u0026#34; build_env_size = 10 job_type = \u0026#34;customize\u0026#34; kubernetes_service = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-service\u0026#34; kubernetes_job = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-customize\u0026#34; id = \u0026#34;ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7\u0026#34; image_root_archive_name = \u0026#34;MY_CUSTOMIZED_IMAGE\u0026#34; initrd_file_name = \u0026#34;initrd\u0026#34; created = \u0026#34;2018-11-21T18:22:53.409405+00:00\u0026#34; kubernetes_namespace = \u0026#34;ims\u0026#34; public_key_id = \u0026#34;a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e\u0026#34; kubernetes_configmap = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-configmap\u0026#34; [[ssh_containers]] status = \u0026#34;pending\u0026#34; jail = false name = \u0026#34;customize\u0026#34; [ssh_containers.connection_info.\u0026#34;cluster.local\u0026#34;] host = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-service.ims.svc.cluster.local\u0026#34; port = 22 [ssh_containers.connection_info.customer_access] host = \u0026#34;ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7.ims.cmn.shasta.cray.com\u0026#34; port = 22   Create variables for the IMS job ID and Kubernetes job ID.\nThe values for these variables are taken from the output of the command in the previous step.

The user needs to know if they will SSH from inside or outside the Kubernetes cluster to determine which host name to use. Typically, customers access the system from outside the Kubernetes cluster using the Customer Access Network (CAN).\nBefore setting the SSH values, determine the appropriate method to SSH into the customization pod:\n [ssh_containers.connection_info.customer_access] values (preferred): The customer_access address is a dynamic hostname that is made available for use by the customer to access the IMS job from outside the Kubernetes cluster. [ssh_containers.connection_info.\u0026quot;cluster.local\u0026quot;] values: The cluster.local address is used when trying to access an IMS job from a pod that is running within the HPE Cray EX Kubernetes cluster. For example, this is the address that CFS uses to talk to the IMS job during a pre-boot customization session.  The external IP address should only be used if the dynamic customer_access hostname does not resolve properly. In the following example, the administrator could then SSH to the 10.103.2.160 IP address.\nncn# kubectl get services -n ims | grep $IMS_JOB_ID Example output:\ncray-ims-06c3dd57-f347-4229-85b3-1d024a947b3f-service LoadBalancer 10.29.129.204 10.103.2.160 22:31627/TCP 21h To create the variables:\nncn# IMS_SSH_HOST=ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7.ims.cmn.shasta.cray.com ncn# IMS_SSH_PORT=22   Describe the image create job.\nncn# kubectl -n ims describe job $IMS_KUBERNETES_JOB Example output:\nName: cray-ims-cfa864b3-4e08-49b1-9c57-04573228fd3f-customize Namespace: default [...] Events: Type Reason Age From Message ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- Normal SuccessfulCreate 4m job-controller Created pod: cray-ims-cfa864b3-4e08-49b1-9c57-04573228fd3f-customize-xh2jf   Record the name of the Kubernetes pod from the previous command.\nThe name is located in the Events section of the output.\nncn# POD=cray-ims-cfa864b3-4e08-49b1-9c57-04573228fd3f-customize-xh2jf   Verify that the status of the IMS job is waiting_on_user.\nncn# cray ims jobs describe $IMS_JOB_ID Example output:\nstatus = \u0026#34;waiting_on_user\u0026#34; enable_debug = false kernel_file_name = \u0026#34;vmlinuz\u0026#34; artifact_id = \u0026#34;4e78488d-4d92-4675-9d83-97adfc17cb19\u0026#34; build_env_size = 10 job_type = \u0026#34;customize\u0026#34; kubernetes_service = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-service\u0026#34; kubernetes_job = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-customize\u0026#34; id = \u0026#34;ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7\u0026#34; image_root_archive_name = \u0026#34;my_customized_image\u0026#34; initrd_file_name = \u0026#34;initrd\u0026#34; created = \u0026#34;2018-11-21T18:22:53.409405+00:00\u0026#34; kubernetes_namespace = \u0026#34;ims\u0026#34; public_key_id = \u0026#34;a252ff6f-c087-4093-a305-122b41824a3e\u0026#34; kubernetes_configmap = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-configmap\u0026#34; [[ssh_containers]] status = \u0026#34;pending\u0026#34; jail = false name = \u0026#34;customize\u0026#34; [ssh_containers.connection_info.\u0026#34;cluster.local\u0026#34;] host = \u0026#34;cray-ims-ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7-service.ims.svc.cluster.local\u0026#34; port = 22 [ssh_containers.connection_info.customer_access] host = \u0026#34;ad5163d2-398d-4e93-94f0-2f439f114fe7.ims.cmn.shasta.cray.com\u0026#34; port = 22   Customize the image in the image customization environment.\n Once in the image root using chroot (or if using a `jailed` environment) during image customization, the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains.

Deleting an IMS image can create a situation where boot artifacts referenced by a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session template no longer exist, making that template unable to boot. Previously, to recover from this situation, an admin would have had to rebuild the boot image using IMS and/or reinstall the prebuilt image from the installer, reapply any Cray and site customizations, and recreate a new BOS template for the IMS image.\nNew functionality has been added to IMS to enable administrators to soft delete, recover (undelete), or hard delete public-keys, recipes, and images. The added functionality provides a way to recover IMS items that were mistakenly deleted. There is no undelete operation for IMS Jobs.\nSoft deleting an IMS record effectively removes the record being deleted from the default collection, and moves it to a new deleted collection. Recovering a deleted IMS record (undelete operation) moves the IMS record from the deleted collection back to the collection of available items. Hard deleting an IMS record permanently deletes it from the deleted collection.\nDelete an IMS Artifact Use the cray CLI utility to delete either soft delete or hard delete an IMS public-key, recipe, or image.\nSoft deleting an IMS public key, recipe, or image removes the record(s) from the collection of available items. Hard deleting permanently removes the item from the deleted collection. Additionally, any linked artifacts are also permanently removed.\nDeleting an IMS public-key, recipe, or image record performs the following actions:\n The IMS record(s) being deleted are moved from the collection of available items to a new deleted collection. Any newly created records within the deleted collection will have the same IMS ID value as it did before being moved there.

	"content": "Image Management The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from compressed Kiwi image descriptions. These compressed Kiwi image descriptions are referred to as \u0026ldquo;recipes.\u0026rdquo; Kiwi-NG builds images based on a variety of different Linux distributions, specifically SUSE, RHEL, and their derivatives. Kiwi image descriptions must follow the Kiwi development schema. More information about the development schema and the Kiwi-NG tool can be found in the documentation: https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/.\nEven though Kiwi recipes can be developed from scratch or found on the Internet, Cray suggests that recipes are based on existing Cray image recipes. Cray provides multiple types of recipes including, but not limited to the following:\n Barebones Image Recipes - The barebones recipes contain only the upstream Linux packages needed to successfully boot the image on a Cray compute node using upstream packages. Bare-bones recipes are primarily meant to be used to validate the Cray IMS tools, without requiring HPE Cray Operating System (COS) content. COS Recipes - COS recipes contain a Linux environment with a Cray customized kernel and optimized Cray services for our most demanding customers and workloads.  Cray provided recipes are uploaded to the Simple Storage Service (S3) and registered with IMS as part of the install.\nImages built by IMS contain only the packages and settings that are referenced in the Kiwi-NG recipe used to build the image. The only exception is that IMS will dynamically install the system\u0026rsquo;s root CA certificate to allow zypper (via Kiwi-NG) to talk securely with the required Nexus RPM repositories. Images that are intended to be used to boot a CN or other node must be configured with DNS and other settings that enable the image to talk to vital services. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to enable DNS resolution, which are typically run against an image after it is built by IMS.\nWhen customizing an image via IMS image customization, once chrooted into the image root (or if using a `jailed` environment), the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains. In order to talk to services, including Nexus RPM repositories, the image root must first be configured with DNS and other settings. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the CFS to enable DNS resolution.\nThe Nexus Repository Manager service provides local RPM repositories for use when building or customizing an image. The Kiwi image descriptions should reference these repositories as needed. In order to include the custom-repo repository in an IMS Kiwi-NG recipe, the repository source path should be modified to the URI for a repository instance hosted by Nexus.\n\u0026lt;repository type=\u0026quot;rpm-md\u0026quot; alias=\u0026quot;custom-repo\u0026quot; imageinclude=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source path=\u0026quot;https://packages.local/repository/REPO_NAME\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/repository\u0026gt; "

	"content": "Image Management Workflows Overview of how to create an image and how to customize and image.\nThe following workflows are intended to be high-level overviews of image management tasks. These workflows depict how services interact with each other during image management and help to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nThe workflows in this section include:\n Create a New Image Customize an Image  Create a New Image Use Case: The system administrator creates an image root from a customized recipe. The new image can be used to boot compute nodes.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the Image Management Service (IMS) with other services during the image build process. The process of image creation builds an image from a recipe. An administrator may choose to use the Cray-provided recipes or customize Kiwi recipes to define the image to be built.\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Image Management Service (IMS) allows administrators and users to build or customize (pre-boot) images from kiwi-ng recipes. This service is responsible for enabling the creation of bootable and non-bootable images, enabling image customization via an SSH-able environment, and packaging and association of new/customized image artifacts (kernel, rootfs, initrd, etc) with a new IMS image record. Nexus is needed for image creation and image customization. Nexus provides local RPM repositories for use when building or customizing an image. You can define zypper or Yum package repositories and provide the RPM content for installing and updating software for every compute and non-compute node in the system. The Simple Storage Service (Ceph S3) is an artifact repository that stores boot artifacts. Recipes are stored in the ims bucket and images are stored in the boot-images bucket.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occurs during this workflow.\n  Administrator downloads an existing recipe from S3\nTo create a custom recipe, the administrator can first download an existing recipe from S3. A Kiwi recipe consists of multiple files and directories, which together define the repositories, packages and post-install actions to take during the Kiwi build process.\n  Administrator modifies the recipe and uploads to S3\nModify the recipe by editing the files and subdirectories in the image-recipe directory. Edit the config.xml file to modify the name of the recipe, the set of RPM packages being installed or the RPM repositories being referenced. The recipe should be uploaded to S3 in a .tgz archive via CLI.\n  Administrator registers the recipe with IMS\nRegistering the recipe creates a recipe record for your custom recipe in IMS.\nncn# cray ims recipes list   Administrator uploads public key\nA public key is uploaded to allow them to access SSH shells that IMS provides.\nncn# cray ims public-keys create --name \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   Administrator starts the creation job\nCreate a new IMS image by providing request body parameter, job_type=\u0026ldquo;create\u0026rdquo;. The following steps 6-10 happen automatically as a part of the image creation process.\nncn# cray ims jobs create \\ --job-type create \\ --image-root-archive-name cray-sles15-barebones \\ --artifact-id $IMS_RECIPE_ID \\ --public-key-id $IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID \\ --enable-debug False   IMS to Ceph S3\nIMS fetches the recipe from S3 and decompresses the recipe to a temporary directory.\n  IMS to Nexus\nIMS waits for repositories to be available from Nexus. The repositories are needed to build the image.\n  IMS creates a custom RPM\nIMS creates a custom RPM to install the CA root certificate from the system into the image. The build-ca-rpm container creates an RPM with the private root-CA certificate for the system and this RPM is installed automatically by Kiwi-NG. The CA root certificate is required to enable secure HTTPS access to the RPM repositories when building the image root.\n  IMS calls Kiwi-NG to build the image\nIMS calls Kiwi-NG to build the image root from the recipe and accesses packages in zypper/yum repositories. The building of the image using kiwi happens in the build-image container. After kiwi is done building the image (either success or fail), the buildenv-sidecar container packages the artifacts, or in the case of failure, enables the debug shell if enable-debug is True. In the buildenv-sidecar container, the image artifacts are packaged and new image artifact records are created for each.\nIf there is a failure and enable-debug is true, a debug SSH shell is established. Admin can inspect image build root. Use commands touch /mnt/image/complete in a non-jailed environment or touch /tmp/complete in a jailed (chroot) environment to exit.\n  Save the new image record in IMS\nThe metadata for the new image artifacts is stored in IMS.\n  Upload the new image artifacts to Ceph S3\nThe new image artifacts are uploaded to Ceph S3.\n  Customize an Image Use Case: The system administrator customizes an existing image and makes desired changes.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the Image Management Service (IMS) with Ceph S3 during the image customization process. The customization workflow sets up a temporary image customization environment within a Kubernetes pod and mounts the image to be customized in that environment. A system administrator then makes the desired changes to the image root within the customization environment. IMS then compresses the customized image root and uploads it and its associated initrd image and kernel image (needed to boot a node) to Ceph S3.\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Image Management Service (IMS) allows administrators and users to build or customize (pre-boot) images from kiwi-ng recipes. This service is responsible for enabling the creation of bootable and non-bootable images, enabling image customization via an SSH-able environment, and packaging and association of new/customized image artifacts (kernel, rootfs, initrd, etc) with a new IMS image record. The Simple Storage Service (Ceph S3) is an artifact repository that stores artifacts. Recipes are stored in the ims bucket and images are stored in the boot-images bucket.  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occurs during this workflow.\n  The administrator identifies an existing image to be customized.\nRetrieve a list of ImageRecords indicating images that have been registered with IMS. IMS uses the ImageRecord to read the image\u0026rsquo;s manifest.yaml to find the image\u0026rsquo;s root file system (rootfs) artifact. Note the id of the image that you want to customize.\nncn# cray ims images list   The administrator uploads a public key.\nA public key is uploaded to allow them to access SSH shells that IMS provides.\nncn# cray ims public-keys create --name \u0026#34;username public key\u0026#34; --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   The administrator starts the image customization job.\nCreate a new IMS image by providing the --job-type customize argument to the cray ims jobs create command. The following steps (4-8) happen automatically as a part of the image customization process.\nncn# cray ims jobs create \\  --job-type customize \\  --image-root-archive-name my_customized_image \\  --kernel-file-name vmlinuz \\  --initrd-file-name initrd \\  --artifact-id $IMS_IMAGE_ID \\  --public-key-id $IMS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID \\  --enable-debug False   IMS to Ceph S3.\nIMS downloads the image root (rootfs) from Ceph S3 and decompresses the image root to a temporary directory.\n  IMS creates an SSH environment for image customization.\nIMS spins up an sshd container so that the administrator can modify the image. The administrator accesses the sshd container and makes changes to the image. For example, it may be necessary to modify the timezone, or modify the programming environment, etc. Use touch /mnt/image/complete in a non-jailed environment or touch /tmp/complete in a jailed (chroot) environment to exit. The shell can be run in either a jailed or non-jailed mode.\nThe output is a new image. Note that the original image also exists. IMS customizes a copy of the original image.\n  buildenv-sidecar container packages new image artifacts.\nThe buildenv-sidecar container waits for the administrator to exit the SSH session. Upon completion, new records are created for each image artifact. It also adds the root CA certificate to the image and packages the new image artifacts (kernel, initrd, rootfs).\n  Save the new image record in IMS.\nThe metadata for the new image artifacts is stored in IMS.\n  Upload the new image artifacts to Ceph S3.\nThe new image artifacts are uploaded to Ceph S3.\n  "

	"content": "Import an External Image to IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) is typically used to build images from IMS recipes and customize Images that are already known to IMS. However, it is sometimes the case that an image is built using a mechanism other than by IMS and needs to be added to IMS. In these cases, the following procedure can be used to add this external image to IMS and upload the image\u0026rsquo;s artifact(s) to the Simple Storage Service (S3).\nPrerequisites  System management services (SMS) are running in a Kubernetes cluster on non-compute nodes (NCN) and include the following deployments:  cray-ims, the Image Management Service (IMS)   kubectl is installed locally and configured to point at the SMS Kubernetes cluster. An image root archive or a pre-built image root SquashFS archive is available. Optionally, additional image artifacts including a kernel, initrd, and kernel parameters file are available. The NCN Certificate Authority (CA) public key has been properly installed into the CA cache for this system. A token providing Simple Storage Service (S3) credentials has been generated.  Limitations  The commands in this procedure must be run as the root user. Images in the .txz compressed format need to be converted to SquashFS in order to use IMS image customization.  Procedure   Ensure that the image root is in a supported format.\nIMS requires that an image\u0026rsquo;s root filesystem is in SquashFS format. Select one of the following options based on the current state of the image root being used:\n If the image being added is in tgz format, refer to Convert TGZ Archives to SquashFS Images. If the image being added meets the above requirements, proceed to Create an IMS image record. If the image root is in a format other than tgz or SquashFS, convert the image root to tgz/SquashFS before continuing.

Kiwi-NG supports multiple ways to modify the post-install configuration of the image root, including some shell scripts (config.sh, images.sh) and the root/overlay directory. To learn how these can be used to add specific configuration to the image root, see the Kiwi-NG documentation.

IMS is not able to dynamically determine the Linux kernel and initrd to look for because the file name for these vary depending upon Linux distribution, Linux version, dracut configuration, and more. Thus, the user must pass the name of the kernel and initrd that IMS will look for in the resultant image root\u0026rsquo;s /boot directory.\nUse the following table to help determine the default kernel and initrd file names to specify when submitting the job to customize an image.

If enable_debug is set to true, then the IMS creation job will enable a debug SSH shell that is accessible by one or more dynamic host names. The user needs to know if they will SSH from inside or outside the Kubernetes cluster to determine which host name to use. Typically, customers access the system from outside the Kubernetes cluster using the Customer Access Network (CAN).\n  If no errors are observed, skip to the 1. Verify that the new image was created correctly step.\nOtherwise, proceed to the following step to debug the failure.\n  Use the IMS_JOB_ID to look up the ID of the newly created image.\nThere may be multiple records returned.

The only exception is that IMS will dynamically install the system\u0026rsquo;s root CA certificate to allow Zypper (via Kiwi-NG) to talk securely with the required Nexus RPM repositories. Images that are intended to be used to boot a CN or other node must be configured with DNS and other settings that enable the image to talk to vital services. A base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to enable DNS resolution; these plays are typically run against an image after it is built by IMS.\nWhen customizing an image via Customize an Image Root Using IMS, once in the image root using chroot (or if using a `jailed` environment), the image will only have access to whatever configuration the image already contains. In order to talk to services, including Nexus RPM repositories, the image root must first be configured with DNS and other settings. That base level of customization is provided by the default Ansible plays used by CFS to enable DNS resolution.\n"

Then use that updated configuration to create UAN boot images and a BOS session template.\nThis is the overall workflow for preparing UAN images for booting UANs:\n Clone the UAN configuration Git repository and create a branch based on the branch imported by the UAN installation. Update the configuration content and push the changes to the newly created branch. Create a Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configuration for the UANs, specifying the Git configuration and the UAN image to apply the configuration to. More Cray products can also be added to the CFS configuration so that the UANs can install multiple Cray products into the UAN image at the same time. Configure the UAN image using CFS and generate a newly configured version of the UAN image. Create a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) boot session template for the UANs. This template maps the configured image, the CFS configuration to be applied post-boot, and the nodes which will receive the image and configuration.  Once the UAN BOS session template is created, then the UANs will be ready to be booted by a BOS session.\nReplace PRODUCT_VERSION and CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME in the example commands in this procedure with the current UAN product version installed (see Obtain UAN artifact IDs and other information) and the hostname of the HPE Cray EX system, respectively.\nPrerequisites The UAN product stream must be installed.\nLimitations This guide only details how to apply UAN-specific configuration to the UAN image and nodes.

The CRAY_EX_HOSTNAME from the clone_url is replaced with api-gw-service-nmn.local in the command that clones the repository.\nncn# git clone https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/uan-config-management.git ncn# cd uan-config-management \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git checkout cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git pull   Create a branch using the imported branch from the installation to customize the UAN image.\nThis imported branch will be reported in the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap in the configuration.import_branch key under the UAN section. The format is cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION. In this guide, an integration branch is used for examples, but the name can be any valid Git branch name.\nModifying the cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION branch that was created by the UAN product installation is not allowed by default.\nncn# git checkout -b integration \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git merge cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION   Configure a root user in the UAN image.\nAdd the encrypted password of the root user from /etc/shadow on an NCN worker to the file group_vars/Application/passwd.yml.\n Skip this step if the root user is already configured in the image.\n Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends configuring a root user in the UAN image for troubleshooting purposes. The entry for root user password will resemble the following example:\nroot_passwd: $6$LmQ/PlWlKixK$VL4ueaZ8YoKOV6yYMA9iH0gCl8F4C/3yC.jMIGfOK6F61h6d.iZ6/QB0NLyex1J7AtOsYvqeycmLj2fQcLjfE1   Apply any site-specific customizations and modifications to the Ansible configuration for the UAN nodes and commit the changes.\nThe default Ansible play to configure UAN nodes is site.yml in the base of the uan-config-management repository. The roles that are executed in this play allow for nondefault configuration as required for the system.\nConsult the individual Ansible role README.md files in the uan-config-management repository roles directory to configure individual role variables. Roles prefixed with uan_ are specific to UAN configuration and include network interfaces, disk, LDAP, software packages, and message of the day roles.\nVariables should be defined and overridden in the Ansible inventory locations of the repository as shown in the following example and not in the Ansible plays and roles defaults. See Ansible Directory Layout.\nWarning: Never place sensitive information such as passwords in the git repository.\nThe following example shows how to add a vars.yml file containing site-specific configuration values to the Application group variable location.\nThese and other Ansible files do not necessarily need to be modified for UAN image creation.\nncn# vim group_vars/Application/vars.yml ncn# git add group_vars/Application/vars.yml ncn# git commit -m \u0026#34;Add vars.yml customizations\u0026#34;   Verify that the System Layout Service (SLS) and the uan_interfaces configuration role refer to the Mountain Node Management Network by the same name.\n Skip this step if there are no Mountain cabinets in the HPE Cray EX system.\n   Edit the roles/uan_interfaces/tasks/main.yml file.\nChange the line that reads url: http://cray-sls/v1/search/networks?name=MNMN to read url: http://cray-sls/v1/search/networks?name=NMN_MTN.\nThe following excerpt of the relevant section of the file shows the result of the change.\n- name: Get Mountain NMN Services Network info from SLS local_action: module: uri url: http://cray-sls/v1/search/networks?name=NMN_MTN method: GET register: sls_mnmn_svcs ignore_errors: yes   Stage and commit the network name change.\nncn# git add roles/uan_interfaces/tasks/main.yml ncn# git commit -m \u0026#34;Add Mountain cabinet support\u0026#34;     Push the changes to the repository using the proper credentials, including the password obtained previously.\nncn# git push --set-upstream origin integration Enter the appropriate credentials when prompted:\nUsername for \u0026#39;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local\u0026#39;: crayvcs Password for \u0026#39;https://crayvcs@api-gw-service-nmn.local\u0026#39;:   Capture the most recent commit for reference in setting up a CFS configuration and navigate to the parent directory.\nncn# git rev-parse --verify HEAD Example commit ID: ecece54b1eb65d484444c4a5ca0b244b329f4667\nNavigate back to the parent directory:\nncn# cd .. The configuration parameters have been stored in a branch in the UAN Git repository. The next phase of the process is initiating the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to customize the image.\n  Configure UAN images   Create a JSON input file for generating a CFS configuration for the UAN.\nGather the git repository clone URL, commit, and top-level play for each configuration layer (that is, Cray product). Add them to the CFS configuration for the UAN, if wanted.\nFor the commit value for the UAN layer, use the Git commit value obtained in the previous step.\nSee the product manuals for further information on configuring other Cray products, as this procedure documents only the configuration of the UAN. More layers can be added to be configured in a single CFS session.\nThe following configuration example can be used for preboot image customization as well as post-boot node configuration.\n{ \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;uan-integration-PRODUCT\\_VERSION\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cloneUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/uan-config-management.git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;playbook\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;site.yml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;commit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ecece54b1eb65d484444c4a5ca0b244b329f4667\u0026#34; } # **{ ... add configuration layers for other products here, if desired ... }** ] }   Add the configuration to CFS using the JSON input file.\nIn the following example, the JSON file created in the previous step is named uan-config-PRODUCT_VERSION.json.

	"content": "Hardware State Manager (HSM) State and Flag Fields HSM manages important information for hardware components in the system. Administrators can use the data returned by HSM to learn about the state of the system. To do so, it is critical that the State and Flag fields are understood, and the next steps to take are known when viewing output returned by HSM commands. It is also beneficial to understand what services can cause State or Flag changes in HSM.\nThe following describes what causes State and Flag changes for all HSM components:\n Initial State/Flag is set upon discovery. This is generally Off/OK or On/OK. BMCs go to Ready/OK instead of On/OK. A component in the Populated state after discovery has an unknown power state. If one is expected for nodes, BMCs, or another component, this is likely due to a firmware issue. Flags can be set to Warning or Alert if the component\u0026rsquo;s Status.Health reads as Warning or Critical via Redfish during discovery. State for all components associated with a BMC is set to Empty if that BMC is removed from the network. State change events from components are consumed by HSM via subscriptions to Redfish events. These are subscribed to and placed on the Kafka bus by hmcollector for HSM\u0026rsquo;s consumption. HSM will update component state based on the information in the Redfish events.  The following describes what causes State and Flag changes for nodes only:\n Heartbeat Tracking Daemon (HBTD) updates the state of nodes based on heartbeats it receives from nodes. HBTD sets the node to Ready/OK when it starts heartbeats. HBTD sets the node to Ready/Warning after a few missed heartbeats. HBTD sets the node to Standby after many missed heartbeats and the node is presumed dead.  State descriptions:\n  Empty\nThe location is not populated with a component.\n  Populated\nPresent (not empty), but no further track can or is being done.\n  Off\nPresent but powered off.\n  On\nPowered on. If no heartbeat mechanism is available, its software state may be unknown.\n  Standby\nNo longer Ready and presumed dead. It typically means the heartbeat has been lost (w/ alert).\n  Ready\nBoth On and Ready to provide its expected services. For example, used for jobs.\n  Flag descriptions:\n  OK\nComponent is OK.\n  Warning\nThere is a non-critical error. Generally coupled with a Ready state.\n  Alert\nThere is a critical error. Generally coupled with a Standby state. Otherwise, reported via Redfish.\n  Hardware State Transitions The following table describes how to interpret when the state of hardware changes:\n   Prior State New State Reason     Ready Standby HBTD if node has many missed heartbeats   Ready Ready/Warning HBTD if node has a few missed heartbeats   Standby Ready HBTD node re-starts heartbeating   On Ready HBTD node started heartbeating   Off Ready HBTD sees heartbeats before Redfish Event (On)   Standby On Redfish Event (On) or if re-discovered while in the standby state   Off On Redfish Event (On)   Standby Off Redfish Event (Off)   Ready Off Redfish Event (Off)   On Off Redfish Event (Off)   Any State Empty Redfish Endpoint is disabled meaning component removal    Generally, nodes transition from Off to On to Ready when going from Off to booted, and from Ready to Ready/Warning to Standby to Off when shut down.\n"

	"content": "Lock and Unlock Management Nodes The ability to ignore non-compute nodes (NCNs) is turned off by default. Management nodes and NCNs are also not locked by default. The administrator must lock the NCNs to prevent unwanted actions from affecting these nodes.\nThis section only covers using locks with the Hardware State Manager (HSM). For more information on ignoring nodes, refer to the following sections:\n Firmware Action Service (FAS): See Ignore Node within FAS. Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC): See Ignore Nodes with CAPMC  The following actions can be prevented when a node is locked.\n Firmware upgrades with FAS Power off operations with CAPMC Reset operations with CAPMC  Doing any of these actions by accident will shut down a management node. If the node is a Kubernetes master or worker node, this can have serious negative effects on system operations. If a single node is taken down by mistake, it is possible that services will recover. If all management nodes are taken down, or all Kubernetes worker nodes are taken down by mistake, the system must be restarted.\nAfter critical nodes are locked, power/reset (CAPMC) or firmware (FAS) operations cannot affect the nodes unless they are unlocked. For example, any locked node that is included in a list of nodes to be reset will result in a failure.\nTopics  When To Lock Management Nodes When To Unlock Management Nodes How To Lock Management Nodes How To Unlock Management Nodes  When To Lock Management Nodes To best protect system health, NCNs should be locked as early as possible in the install/upgrade cycle. The later in the process, the more risk there is of accidentally taking down a critical node. NCN locking must be done after Kubernetes is running and the HSM service is operational.\nCheck whether HSM is running with the following command:\nncn# kubectl -n services get pods | grep smd Example output:\ncray-smd-848bcc875c-6wqsh 2/2 Running 0 9d cray-smd-848bcc875c-hznqj 2/2 Running 0 9d cray-smd-848bcc875c-tp6gf 2/2 Running 0 6d22h cray-smd-init-2tnnq 0/2 Completed 0 9d cray-smd-postgres-0 2/2 Running 0 19d cray-smd-postgres-1 2/2 Running 0 6d21h cray-smd-postgres-2 2/2 Running 0 19d cray-smd-wait-for-postgres-4-7c78j 0/3 Completed 0 9d The cray-smd pods need to be in the Running state, except for cray-smd-init and cray-smd-wait-for-postgres which should be in Completed state.\nWhen To Unlock Management Nodes Any time a management NCN has to be power cycled, reset, or have its firmware updated, it will first need to be unlocked. After the operation is complete, the targeted nodes should once again be locked.\nHow To Lock Management Nodes Use the cray hsm locks lock command to perform locking.\nNOTE: When locking NCNs, you must lock their NodeBMCs as well.\nTo lock all nodes (and their BMCs) with the Management role The processing-model rigid parameter means that the operation must succeed on all target nodes or the entire operation will fail.\n  Lock the management nodes.\nncn# cray hsm locks lock create --role Management --processing-model rigid Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 8 Success = 8 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s5b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s4b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s7b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s3b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s2b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s9b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s8b0n0\u0026quot;,]   Lock the NodeBMCs of those management nodes.\nncn# cray hsm locks lock create --component-ids \\  $(cray hsm state components list --role management --type node --format json | jq \u0026#39;.Components[].ID\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/n[0-9]*//;s/\u0026#34;//g\u0026#39; | tr \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/.$//\u0026#39;) Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 8 Success = 8 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s5b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s4b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s7b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s3b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s2b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s9b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s8b0\u0026quot;,]   To lock single nodes or lists of specific nodes (and their BMCs)   Lock the management nodes.\nncn# cray hsm locks lock create --role Management --component-ids x3000c0s6b0n0 --processing-model rigid Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 1 Success = 1 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026#34;x3000c0s6b0n0\u0026#34;,]   Lock the BMC of those nodes.\n Note: The BMC of ncn-m001 typically does not exist in HSM under HSM State Components, and therefore cannot be locked.\n  Remove n0 from all of the xnames to get a list of the NodeBMCs that need to be locked.\n ncn# cray hsm locks lock create --component-ids x3000c0s6b0 --processing-model rigid Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 1 Success = 1 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0\u0026quot;,]   How To Unlock Management Nodes Use the cray hsm locks unlock command to perform unlocking.\nNOTE: When unlocking NCNs, you must unlock their NodeBMCs as well.\nTo unlock all nodes (and their BMCs) with the Management role   Unlock the management nodes.\nncn# cray hsm locks unlock create --role Management --processing-model rigid Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 8 Success = 8 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s7b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s3b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s2b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s9b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s8b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s5b0n0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s4b0n0\u0026quot;,]   Unlock the BMCs of those management nodes.\nncn# cray hsm locks unlock create --component-ids \\  $(cray hsm state components list --role management --type node --format json | jq \u0026#39;.Components[].ID\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/n[0-9]*//;s/\u0026#34;//g\u0026#39; | tr \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/.$//\u0026#39;) Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 8 Success = 8 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s5b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s4b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s7b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s3b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s2b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s9b0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;x3000c0s8b0\u0026quot;,]   To unlock single or lists of specific nodes (and their BMCs)   Unlock the management nodes.\nncn# cray hsm locks unlock create --role Management --component-ids x3000c0s6b0n0 --processing-model rigid Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 1 Success = 1 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0n0\u0026quot;,]   Unlock the BMCs of those management nodes.\n Remove n0 from all of the xnames to get a list of the NodeBMCs that need to be locked.\n ncn# cray hsm locks unlock create --component-ids x3000c0s6b0 --processing-model rigid Example output:\nFailure = [] [Counts] Total = 1 Success = 1 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026quot;x3000c0s6b0\u0026quot;,]   "

	"content": "Manage HMS Locks This section describes how to check the status of a lock, disable reservations, and repair reservations. The disable and repair operations only affect the ability to make reservations on hardware devices.\nSome of the common scenarios an admin might encounter when working with the Hardware State Manager (HSM) Locking API are also described.\nCheck Lock Status Use the following command to verify if a component name (xname) is locked or not. The command will show if it is locked (admin), reserved (service command), or reservation disabled (either an EPO or an admin command).\nThe following shows how to interpret the output:\n Locked: Shows if the component name (xname) has been locked with the cray hsm locks lock create command. Reserved: Shows if the component name (xname) has been locked for a time-boxed event. Only service can reserve component names (xnames); administrators are not able to reserve component names (xnames). ReservationDisable: Shows if the ability to reserve a component name (xname) has been changed by an EPO or admin command.  ncn-m001# cray hsm locks status create --component-ids x1003c5s2b1n1 NotFound = [] [[Components]] ID = \u0026#34;x1003c5s2b1n1\u0026#34; Locked = false Reserved = false ReservationDisabled = false Disable Reservations Disabling a lock prevents a service from being able to make a reservation on it, and it releases/ends any current reservations. Even though SMD removes the reservation when disabling a lock, it does not mean that the Firmware Action Service (FAS) is aware that it has lost the reservation. Additionally, if CAPMC has a reservation that is cancelled, disabled, or broken, it will do nothing to the existing CAPMC operation. There are no checks by CAPMC to make sure things are still reserved at any time during a power operation.\nThis is a way to stop new operations from happening, not a way to prevent currently executing operations.\nncn-m001# cray hsm locks disable create --component-ids x1003c5s2b1n1 Failure = [] [Counts] Total = 1 Success = 1 Failure = 0 [Success] ComponentIDs = [ \u0026#34;x1003c5s2b1n1\u0026#34;,] The following is an example of a when a lock is disabled:\nncn-m001# cray hsm locks status create --component-ids x1003c5s2b1n1 NotFound = [] [[Components]] ID = \u0026#34;x1003c5s2b1n1\u0026#34; Locked = false Reserved = false ReservationDisabled = true Repair Reservations Locks must be manually repaired after disabling a component or performing a manual EPO.

	"content": "Component Groups and Partitions The Hardware State Manager (HSM) provides the group and partition services. Both are means of grouping (also known as labeling) system components that are tracked by HSM. Components include the nodes, blades, controllers, and more on a system.\nThere is no limit to the number of members a group or partition contains. The only limitation is that all members must be actual members of the system. The HSM needs to know that the components exist.\nGroups Groups are collections of components (primarily nodes) in /hsm/v2/State/Components. Components can be members of any number of groups. Groups can be created freely, and HSM does not assign them any predetermined meaning.\nIf a group has exclusiveGroup=EXCLUSIVE_LABEL_NAME set, then a component may only be a member of one group that matches that exclusive label. For example, if the exclusive group label colors is associated with groups blue, red, and green, then a node that is part of the green group could not also be placed in the red group.\nPartitions Partitions are isolated, non-overlapping groups. Each component can be a member of only one partition at a time, and partitions are used as an access control mechanism. Partitions have a specific predefined meaning, intended to provide logical divisions of a single physical system.\n"

Each procedure includes the prerequisites and example recipes required to update the firmware.\nWhen updating an entire system, walk down the device hierarchy component type by component type, starting first with Routers (switches), proceeding to Chassis, and then finally to Nodes.

The targets can be run in the same action (as shown in the example) or run separately by only including one target in the action. On larger systems, it is recommended to run as two actions one after each other as the output will be shorter.\nPrerequisites  The Cray nodeBMC device needs to be updated before the nodeBIOS because the nodeBMC adds a new Redfish field (softwareId) that the NodeX.BIOS update will require. See Update Liquid-Cooled Node Firmware for more information. Compute node BIOS updates require the nodes to be off. If nodes are not off when the update command is issued, it will report as a failed update.   IMPORTANT: The nodes themselves must be powered off in order to update the BIOS on the nodes. The BMC will still have power and will perform the update.\n  IMPORTANT: When the BMC is updated or rebooted after updating the Node0.BIOS and/or Node1.BIOS liquid-cooled nodes, the node BIOS version will not report the new version string until the nodes are powered back on. It is recommended that the Node0/1 BIOS be updated in a separate action, either before or after a BMC update.

Compute Node BIOS Workaround for HPE CRAY EX425 Correct an issue where the model of the liquid-cooled compute node BIOS is the incorrect name. The name has changed from WNC-ROME to HPE CRAY EX425 or HPE CRAY EX425 (ROME).\nPrerequisites   The system is running HPE Cray EX release v1.4 or higher.\n  The system has completed the Cray System Management (CSM) installation.\n  A firmware upgrade has been done following Update Liquid-Cooled Compute Node BIOS Firmware.\n The result of the upgrade is that the NodeX.BIOS has failed as noSolution and the stateHelper field for the operation states is \u0026quot;No Image Available\u0026quot;. The BIOS in question is running a version less than or equal to 1.2.5 as reported by Redfish or described by the noSolution operation in FAS.    The hardware model reported by Redfish is wnc-rome, which is now designated as HPE CRAY EX425.\nIf the Redfish model is different (ignoring casing) and the blades in question are not Windom, contact customer support.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Hardware Management Services (HMS) Locking API The locking feature is a part of the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API. The locking API enables administrators to lock components on the system. Locking components ensures other system actors, such as administrators or running services, cannot perform a firmware update with the Firmware Action Service (FAS) or a power state change with the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC). Locks only constrain FAS and CAPMC from each other and help ensure that a firmware update action will not be interfered with by a request to power off the device through CAPMC. Locks only work with HMS services and will not impact other system services.\nLocks can only be used to prevent actions firmware updates with FAS or power state changes with CAPMC. Administrators can still use HMS APIs to view the state of various hardware components on the system, even if a lock is in place. There is no automatic locking for hardware devices. Locks need to be manually set or unset by an admin. A scenario that might be encountered is when a larger hardware state change job is run, and one of the components in the job has a lock on it. If FAS is the service running the job, FAS will attempt to update the firmware on each component, and will update all devices that do not have a lock on it. The job will not complete until the node lock ends, or if a timeout is set for the job.\nThe locking API also includes actions to repair or disable a node\u0026rsquo;s locking ability with respect to HMS services. The disable function will make it so a device cannot be firmware updated or power controlled (via an HMS service) until a repair is done. Future requests to perform a firmware update via FAS or power state change via CAPMC cannot be made on that component until the repair action is used.\nWarning: System administrators should LOCK NCNs after the system has been brought up to prevent an admin from unintentionally firmware updating or powering off an NCN. If this lock is not engaged, an authorized request to FAS or CAPMC could power off the NCNs, which will negatively impact system stability and the health of services running on those NCNs.\n"

	"content": "Update Firmware with FAS The Firmware Action Service (FAS) provides an interface for managing firmware versions of Redfish-enabled hardware in the system. FAS interacts with the Hardware State Managers (HSM), device data, and image data in order to update firmware.\nReset Gigabyte node BMC to factory defaults if having problems with ipmitool, using Redfish, or when flashing procedures fail. See Set Gigabyte Node BMC to Factory Defaults.\nFAS images contain the following information that is needed for a hardware device to update firmware versions:\n Hardware-specific information: Contains the allowed device states and how to reboot a device if necessary. Selection criteria: How to link a firmware image to a specific hardware type. Image data: Where the firmware image resides in Simple Storage Service (S3) and what firmwareVersion it will report after it is successfully applied. See Artifact Management for more information.  Topics  Prerequisites Warning Current Capabilities Order Of Operations Hardware Precedence Order FAS Admin Procedures Firmware Actions Firmware Operations Firmware Images  Prerequisites  CSM software has been installed, firmware has been loaded into FAS as part of the HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) install, HSM is running, and nodes have been discovered. All management nodes have been locked. Identify the type and manufacturers of hardware in the system. If Gigabyte nodes are not in use on the system, do not update them!  Warning Non-compute nodes (NCNs) and their BMCs should be locked with the HSM locking API to ensure they are not unintentionally updated by FAS. See Lock and Unlock Management Nodes for more information. Failure to lock the NCNs could result in unintentional update of the NCNs if FAS is not used correctly; this will lead to system instability problems.\nFollow the process outlined in FAS CLI to update the system. Use the recipes listed in FAS Recipes to update each supported type.\n NOTE: Each system is different and may not have all hardware options.\n Current Capabilities The following table describes the hardware items that can have their firmware updated via FAS. For more information about the upgradable targets, refer to the Firmware product stream repository.\nTable 1. Upgradable Firmware Items\n   Manufacturer Type Target     Cray nodeBMC BMC, Node0.BIOS, Node1.BIOS, Recovery, Node1.AccFPGA0, Node0.AccFPGA0   Cray chassisBMC BMC, Recovery   Cray routerBMC BMC, Recovery   Gigabyte nodeBMC BMC, BIOS   HPE nodeBMC iLO 5 (BMC aka 1 ), System ROM ,Redundant System ROM (BIOS aka 2)    Order Of Operations For each item in the Hardware Precedence Order:\n  Complete a dry-run:\n cray fas actions create {jsonfile} Note the ActionID. Poll the status of the action until the action state is completed:  cray fas actions describe {actionID} --format json      Interpret the outcome of the dry-run. Look at the counts and determine if the dry-run identified any hardware to update:\nFor the steps below, the following returned messages will help determine if a firmware update is needed. The following are end states for operations. The Firmware action itself should be in completed once all operations have finished.\n NoOp: Nothing to do; already at the requested version. NoSol: No viable image is available; this will not be updated. succeeded:  IF dryrun: The operation should succeed if performed as a live update. succeeded means that FAS identified that it COULD update a component name (xname) and target with the declared strategy. IF live update: The operation succeeded and has updated the component name (xname) and target to the identified version.   failed:  IF dryrun: There is something that FAS could do, but it likely would fail (most likely because the file is missing). IF live update: The operation failed. The identified version could not be put on the component name (xname) and target.      If succeeded count \u0026gt; 0, now perform a live update.\n  Update the JSON file overrideDryrun to true:\n cray fas actions create {jsonfile} Note the ActionID! Poll the status of the action until the action state is completed:  cray fas actions describe {actionID} --format json      Interpret the outcome of the live update; proceed to next type of hardware.\n  Hardware Precedence Order After identifying which hardware is in the system, start with the top most item on this list to update. If any of the following hardware is not in the system, skip it.\n IMPORTANT:\n This process does not communicate the SAFE way to update NCNs. If the NCNs and their BMCs have not been locked, or FAS is blindly used to update NCNs without following the correct process, then THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE JEOPARDIZED. Read the corresponding recipes before updating. There are sometimes ancillary actions that must be completed in order to ensure update integrity.    NOTE: To update Switch Controllers (sC) or RouterBMC, refer to the Rosetta Documentation.\n  Cray  ChassisBMC NodeBMC  BMC NodeBIOS Redstone FPGA     Gigabyte  BMC BIOS   HPE  BMC (iLO5) BIOS (System ROM)    FAS Admin Procedures There are several use cases for using the FAS to update firmware on the system. These use cases are intended to be run by system administrators with a good understanding of firmware. Under no circumstances should non-administrator users attempt to use FAS or perform a firmware update.\n Perform a firmware update: Update the firmware of a component name (xname)\u0026rsquo;s target to the latest, earliest, or an explicit version. Determine what hardware can be updated by performing a dry-run: This is the easiest way to determine what can be updated. Take a snapshot of the system: Record the firmware versions present on each target for the identified component names (xnames). If the firmware version corresponds to an image available in the images repository, link the imageID to the record. Restore the snapshot of the system: Take the previously recorded snapshot and use the related imageIDs to put the component name (xname)/targets back to the firmware version they were at, at the time of the snapshot. Provide firmware for updating: FAS can only update a component name (xname)/target if it has an image record that is applicable. Most administrators will not encounter this use case.  Firmware Actions An action is collection of operations, which are individual firmware update tasks. Only one FAS action can be run at a time. Any other attempted action will be queued. Additionally, only one operation can be run on a component name (xname) at a time. For example, if there are 1000 xnames with 5 targets each to be updated, then all 1000 xnames can be updating a target, but only 1 target on each xname will be updated at a time.\nThe life cycle of any action can be divided into the static and dynamic portions of the life cycle.\nThe static portion of the life cycle is where the action is created and configured. It begins with a request to create an action through either of the following requests:\n Direct: Request to /actions API. Indirect: Request to restore a snapshot via the /snapshots API.  The dynamic portion of the life cycle is where the action is executed to completion. It begins when the actions is transitioned from the new to configured state. The action will then be ultimately transitioned to an end state of aborted or completed.\nFirmware Operations Operations are individual tasks in a FAS action. FAS will create operations based on the configuration sent through the actions create command. FAS operations will have one of the following states:\n initial - Operation just created. configured - The operation is configured, but nothing has been started. blocked - Only one operation can be performed on a node at a time. If more than one update is required for a component name (xname), then operations will be blocked. This will have a message of blocked by sibling. inProgress - Update is in progress, but not completed. verifying - Waiting for update to complete. failed - An update was attempted, but FAS is unable to tell that the update succeeded in the allotted time. noOperation - Firmware is at the correct version according to the images loaded into FAS. noSolution - FAS does not have a suitable image for an update. aborted - The operation was aborted before it could determine if it was successful. If aborted after the update command was sent to the node, then the node may still have updated.  Firmware Images FAS requires images in order to update firmware for any device on the system. An image contains the data that allows FAS to establish a link between an admin command, available devices (xname/targets), and available firmware.\nThe following is an example of an image:\n{ \u0026#34;imageID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-05-11T17:11:07.017Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nodeBMC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;manufacturer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;intel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;s2600\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;s2600_REV_a\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;BIOS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;recovery\u0026#34;, default\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;firmwareVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f1.123.24xz\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;semanticFirmwareVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v1.2.252\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;updateURI\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/redfish/v1/Systems/UpdateService/BIOS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;needManualReboot\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;waitTimeBeforeManualRebootSeconds\u0026#34;: 600, \u0026#34;waitTimeAfterRebootSeconds\u0026#34;: 180, \u0026#34;pollingSpeedSeconds\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;forceResetType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ForceRestart\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s3URL\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3://firmware/f1.1123.24.xz.iso\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowableDeviceStates\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;On\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Off\u0026#34; ] } The main components of an image are described below:\n  Key\nThis includes the deviceType, manufacturer, model, target, tag, semanticFirmwareVersion (firmware version) fields.\nThese fields are how administrators assess what firmware is on a device, and if an image is applicable to that device.\n  Process guides\nThis includes the forceResetType, pollingSpeedSeconds, waitTime(s), allowableDeviceStates fields.\nFAS gets information about how to update the firmware from these fields.

Prerequisites The user performing these procedures needs to have access permission to the cray-console-operator and cray-console-node pods.\nConnection procedure   When trying to monitor a worker node that will be rebooted or powered down, first follow the Evacuation procedure.\n  Find the cray-console-operator pod.\nncn-mw# OP_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n services \\  -o wide|grep cray-console-operator|awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39;) ncn-mw# echo $OP_POD Example output:\ncray-console-operator-6cf89ff566-kfnjr   Find the cray-console-node pod that is connecting with the console.\nncn-mw# NODE_POD=$(kubectl -n services exec $OP_POD -c cray-console-operator -- sh -c \\  \u0026#34;/app/get-node $XNAME\u0026#34; | jq .podname | sed \u0026#39;s/\u0026#34;//g\u0026#39;) ncn-mw# echo $NODE_POD Example output:\ncray-console-node-1   Establish a serial console session with the desired NCN.\nncn-mw# kubectl -n services exec -it $NODE_POD -- conman -j $XNAME The console session log files for each NCN are located in a shared volume in the cray-console-node pods. In those pods, the log files are in the /var/log/conman/ directory and are named console.\u0026lt;xname\u0026gt;.\nIMPORTANT: If the cray-console-node pod the user is connected through is running on the same NCN that the console session is connected to, and a reboot of that same NCN is initiated, then expect the connection to terminate and there to be a gap in the console log file. The gap will last until the console connection is reestablished through a different cray-console-node pod or until the existing pod is restarted on a different NCN.

Research Lock and Unlock Management Nodes for more information. Failure to lock the NCNs could result in unintentional update of the NCNs if FAS is not used correctly; this will lead to system instability problems.\n Ignore Nodes within FAS The default configuration of FAS no longer ignores management nodes, which prevents FAS from firmware updating the NCNs. To reconfigure the FAS deployment to exclude non-compute nodes (NCNs) and ensure they cannot have their firmware upgraded, the NODE_BLACKLIST value must be manually enabled.\nPreferred Method: Nodes can also be locked with the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API. Refer to Lock and Unlock Management Nodes for more information.\nProcedure to Ignore Nodes   Check that there are no FAS actions running.\nncn# cray fas actions list   Edit the cray-fas deployment.\nncn# kubectl -n services edit deployment cray-fas   Change the NODE_BLACKLIST value from ignore_ignore_ignore to management.\n  Save and quit the deployment. This will restart FAS.\n   Override an Image for an Update If an update fails because of \u0026quot;No Image available\u0026quot;, it may be caused by FAS being unable to to find an image in the image list that matches the data on the node.\n\nProcedure to Override an Image   Find the available image in FAS.\nChange TARGETNAME to the actual target being searched.\nncn# cray fas images list --format json | jq \u0026#39;.[] | .[] | select(.target==\u0026#34;TARGETNAME\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; To narrow down the selection, update the select field to match multiple items.

It is strongly recommended to run a dry-run (overrideDryrun=false) first and check the actions output.\n Check for New Firmware Versions with a Dry-Run Use the Firmware Action Service (FAS) dry-run feature to determine what firmware can be updated on the system. Dry-runs are enabled by default, and can be configured with the overrideDryrun parameter. A dry-run will create a query according to the filters requested by the admin. It will initiate an update sequence to determine what firmware is available, but will not actually change the state of the firmware.\n WARNING: It is crucial that an administrator is familiar with the release notes of any firmware. The release notes will indicate what new features the firmware provides and if there are any incompatibilities. FAS does not know about incompatibilities or dependencies between versions. The administrator assumes full responsibility for this knowledge.\n It is likely that when performing a firmware update, that the current version of firmware will not be available. This means that after successfully upgrading, the firmware cannot be downgraded.\nThis procedure includes information on how check the firmware versions for the entire system, as well as how to target specific manufacturers, component names (xnames), and targets.\nProcedure to Check for New Firmware   Run a dry-run firmware update.\nThe following command parameters should be included in dry-run JSON files:\n overrideDryrun: The overrideDryrun parameter is set to false by default. FAS will only update the system if this is parameter is set to true. restoreNotPossibleOverride: FAS will not perform an update if the currently running firmware is not available in the images repository. Set this parameter to true in order to allow FAS to update firmware even if the current firmware is unavailable on the system. description: A brief description that helps administrators distinguish between actions. version: Determines if the firmware should be set to the latest, the earliest semantic version, or set to a specific firmware version.

	"content": "FAS CLI This section describes the basic capabilities of the Firmware Action Service (FAS) CLI commands. These commands can be used to manage firmware for system hardware supported by FAS. Refer to the prerequisites section before proceeding to any of the sections for the supported operations.\nThe following CLI operations are described:\n Action  Execute an Action Abort an Action Describe an Action   Snapshots  Create a Snapshot View a Snapshot List Snapshots   Update an Image FAS Loader Commands  Prerequisites The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system.\nExecute an Action Use FAS to execute an action. An action produces a set of firmware operations. Each operation represents a component name (xname) and a target on that xname that will be targeted for update. There are two modes of firmware action: dryrun and liveupdate. The parameters used when creating either are identical except for the overrideDryrun setting. The overrideDryrun setting is false by default. This mode (the dry-run mode) will create a query according to the filters requested by the administrator. This will initiate an update sequence to determine what firmware is available, but will not actually change the state of the firmware.\n WARNING: It is crucial that an administrator is familiar with the release notes of any firmware. The release notes will indicate what new features the firmware provides and if there are any incompatibilities. FAS does not know about incompatibilities or dependencies between versions. The administrator assumes full responsibility for this knowledge. It is also likely that when performing a firmware update, the current version of firmware will not be available. This means that after successfully upgrading, the firmware cannot be reverted or downgraded to a previous version.\n Procedure This will cover the generic process for executing an action. For more specific examples and detailed explanations of options see the Recipes and Filters sections.\n  Identify the selection of filters to apply.\nFilters narrow the scope of FAS to target specific component names (xnames), manufacturers, targets, and so on. For this example, FAS will run with no selection filters applied.\n  Create a JSON file (whole-system-dryrun.json); to make this a live update, set \u0026quot;overrideDryrun\u0026quot;: true.\n{ \u0026#34;command\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;overrideDryrun\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;restoreNotPossibleOverride\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;timeLimit\u0026#34;: 1000, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dryrun of full system\u0026#34; } }   Execute the dry-run.\nncn# cray fas actions create {whole-system-dryrun.json} [...] { \u0026#34;actionID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;e0cdd7c2-32b1-4a25-9b2a-8e74217eafa7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;overrideDryun\u0026#34;: false }   Note the returned actionID.\nSee Interpreting Output for more information.\nAbort an Action Firmware updates can be stopped if required. This is useful given only one action can be run at a time. This is to protect hardware from multiple actions trying to modify it at the same time.\n IMPORTANT: If a Redfish update is already in progress, the abort will not stop that process on the device. It is likely the device will update. If the device needs to be manually power cycled (needManualReboot), it is possible that the device will update, but not actually apply the update until its next reboot. Administrators must verify the state of the system after an abort. Only perform an abort if truly necessary. The best way to check the state of the system is to do a snapshot or do a dry-run of an update.\n Procedure   Issue the abort command to the action.\nncn# cray fas actions instance delete {actionID}   The action could take up to a minute to fully abort.\nDescribe an Action There are several ways to get more information about a firmware update. An actionID and operationIDs are generated when a live update or dry-run is created. These values can be used to learn more about what is happening on the system during an update.\nInterpreting Output For the steps below, the following returned messages will help determine if a firmware update is needed. The following are final state values for operations within a firmware action. The overall firmware action itself should have a state of completed once all operations have finished.\n NoOp: Nothing to do, already at version. NoSol: No image is available. succeeded:  IF dryrun: The operation should succeed if performed as a live update. succeeded means that FAS identified that it COULD update a component name (xname) + target with the declared strategy. IF live update: the operation succeeded, and has updated the component name (xname) + target to the identified version.   failed:  IF dryrun : There is something that FAS could do, but it likely would fail; most likely because the file is missing. IF live update : the operation failed, the identified version could not be put on the component name (xname) + target.

	"title": "FAS Filters",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "FAS Filters FAS uses five primary filters for actions and snapshots to determine what operations to create. The filters are listed below:\n Selection Filters - Determine what operations will be created. The following selection filters are available:  stateComponentFilter targetFilter inventoryHardwareFilter  imageFilter   Command Filters - Determine how the operations will be executed. The following command filters are available:  command    All filters are logically connected with AND logic. Only the stateComponentFilter, targetFilter, and inventoryHardwareFilter are used for snapshots.\n Selection Filters stateComponentFilter The state component filter allows users to select hardware to update. Hardware can be selected individually with component names (xnames), or in groups by leveraging the Hardware State Manager (HSM) groups and partitions features.\nParameters  xnames - A list of component names (xnames) to target. partitions - A partition to target. groups- A group to target. deviceTypes Set to NodeBMC, RouterBMC, or ChassisBMC. These are the ONLY three allowed types and come from the Hardware State Manager (HSM).   inventoryHardwareFilter The inventory hardware filter takes place after the state component filter has been applied. It will remove any devices that do not conform to the identified manufacturer or models determined by querying the Redfish endpoint.\n IMPORTANT: There can be a mismatch of hardware models. The model field is human-readable and is human-programmable. In some cases, there can be typos where the wrong model is programmed, which causes issues filtering. If this occurs, query the hardware, find the model name, and add it to the images repository on the desired image.\n Parameters  manufacturer - Set to Cray, HPE, or Gigabyte. model - The Redfish reported model, which can be specified.   imageFilter FAS applies images to component name (xname)/targets. The image filter is a way to specify an explicit image that should be used. When included with other filters, the image filter reduces the devices considered to only those devices where the image can be applied.\nFor example, consider if a user specifies an image that only applies to Gigabyte nodeBMC BIOS targets. If all hardware in the system is targeted with an empty stateComponentFilter, FAS would find all devices in the system that can be updated via Redfish, and then the image filter would remove all component name (xname)/ targets that this image could not be applied to. In this example, FAS would remove any device that is not a Gigabyte nodeBMC, as well as any target that is not BIOS.\nParameters  imageID - The ID of the image to force onto the system. overrideImage - If this is combined with imageID, then it will FORCE the selected image onto all hardware identified, even if it is not applicable.  WARNING: This may cause undesirable outcomes, but most hardware will prevent a bad image from being loaded.\n    targetFilter The target filter selects targets that match against the list. For example, if the user specifies only the BIOS target, FAS will include only operations that explicitly have BIOS as a target. A Redfish device has potentially many targets (members). Targets for FAS are case sensitive and must match Redfish.\nParameters  targets - The actual \u0026lsquo;members\u0026rsquo; that will be upgraded. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:  BIOS BMC NIC Node0.BIOS Node1.BIOS Recovery     Command Filters command The command group is the most important part of an action command and controls if the action is executed as dry-run or a live update.\nIt also determines whether or not to override an operation that would normally not be executed if there is no way to return the component name (xname)/target to the previous firmware version. This happens if an image does not exist in the image repository.\nThese filters are then applied; and then command parameter applies settings for the overall action. The swagger file is a great reference.\nParameters  version - Usually latest because that is the most common use case. tag - Usually default because the default image is the most useful one to use. This parameter can usually be ignored. overrideDryrun - This determines if this is a LIVE UPDATE or a DRY-RUN. If doing an override; then it will provide a live update. restoreNotPossibleOverride - This determines if an update (live or dry-run) will be attempted if a restore cannot be performed. Typically there is not enough firmware to be able to do a rollback, which means if the system is an UPDATE away from a particular version, it cannot go back to a previous version. It is most likely that this value will ALWAYS need to be set true. overwriteSameImage - This will cause a firmware update to be performed EVEN if the device is already at the identified, selected version. timeLimit - This is the amount of time in seconds that any operation should be allowed to execute. Most cray hardware can be completed in approximately 1000 seconds or less; but the gigabyte hardware will commonly take 1500 seconds or greater. Setting the value to 4000 is recommended as a stop gap to prevent the operation from never ending, should something get stuck. description- A human-friendly description that should be set to give useful information about the firmware operation.

The cray CLI configuration needs to be initialized for the Linux account, and the Keycloak user running the procedure needs to be authorized. This section describes how to initialize the cray CLI for use by a user and how to authorize that user.\nThe cray CLI only needs to be initialized once per user on a node.\nProcedure   Unset the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable, if previously set.\nSome CSM installation procedures use the CLI with a Kubernetes managed service account that is normally used for internal operations. There is a procedure for extracting the OAUTH token for this service account and assigning it to the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable to permit simple CLI operations. It must be unset in order to validate that the CLI is working with user authentication.\nncn# unset CRAY_CREDENTIALS   Initialize the cray CLI for the root account.\nThe cray CLI needs to know what host to use to obtain authorization and what user is requesting authorization, so it can obtain an OAUTH token to talk to the API gateway. This is accomplished by initializing the CLI configuration.\nIn this example, the vers username is used. It should be replaced with an appropriate user account:\n If LDAP configuration was enabled, then use a valid account in LDAP. If LDAP configuration was not enabled, or is not working, then a Keycloak local account may be created. See Configure Keycloak Account to create this local account in Keycloak.  ncn# cray init --hostname api-gw-service-nmn.local Expected output (including the typed input) should look similar to the following:\nUsername: vers Password: Success!

	"content": "VCS Branching Strategy Individual products import configuration content (Ansible plays, roles, and more) into a repository in the Version Control Service (VCS) through their installation process. Typically, this repository exists in the cray organization in VCS and its name has the format [product name]-config-management.\nThe import branch of the product is considered \u0026ldquo;pristine content\u0026rdquo; and is added to VCS in a read-only branch. This step is taken to ensure the future updates of the product\u0026rsquo;s configuration content can be based on a clean branch, and that upgrades can proceed without merging issues.\nHPE Cray products import their content into a branch with a name that has the format cray/[product]/[product version].\nThe version is in SemVer format. Product installation and operational workflows will direct users to create branches from these pristine product branches to begin customizing their configuration from the default provided by the HPE Cray product.\nThe workflow of branching from pristine imported content and handling upgrades to that content is shown in the diagram below (see \u0026ldquo;Branch Workflow\u0026rdquo;). In this scenario, the configuration customizations are made in a customer/main branch, which can be any branch in the repository, such as master, main, integration, or others. As configuration changes are made and the system is configured as required, users can point to the commits (white circles) in their CFS configuration layers to test and run HPE Cray products on the system. Users may also point to the commits on pristine branches (blue circle) in CFS configuration layers if the default configuration is sufficient.\nWhen a product upgrade occurs (cray/product/1.4.0 in the above diagram), the product installer will create a new branch and commit based off the previous pristine branch. If the previous customizations on the customer/main branch also need to be included with the new 1.4.0 content, the user should initiate a Git merge of the new pristine content into their branch (or possibly into a test branch based on customer/main). This process will be the same for subsequent updates of the product as well.\nImportant: If the Cray product has specific instructions for installing and upgrading configuration content, those should take precedence over this generic workflow.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Branch Workflow\u0026rdquo; diagram is an example workflow that can be used to manage new product content being introduced during upgrades. However, CFS and VCS do not require any specific branching strategy. Users are free to manage the branches as they see fit with the exception of the pristine branches imported by individual HPE Cray products. CFS configuration layers (see Configuration Layers) only require a Git commit ID, a Git repository clone URL, and the path to an Ansible playbook to run the configuration content in the repository.\n"

As a result, users configured via Keycloak can log in and create organizations and repositories of their own, but they cannot modify the cray organization that is created during system installation, unless they are given permissions to do so.\nThe crayvcs Gitea admin user that is created during CSM installation can log in to the UI via Keycloak. To allow users other than crayvcs to have access to repositories in the cray organization, use the following procedure:\n  Log in to VCS as the crayvcs user on the system.\nURL: https://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME\n  Navigate to the cray organization owners page.\nURL: https://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME/vcs/cray/teams/owners\n  Enter the username of the user who should have access to the organization in the Search user... text field, and click the Add Team Member button.\n   IMPORTANT The Owner role has full access to all repositories in the organization, as well as administrative access to the organization, including the ability to create and delete repositories.\n For granting non-administrative access to the organization and its repositories, create a new team at the following URL:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME/vcs/org/cray/teams/new\nSelect the permissions appropriately, and then navigate to the following URL to add members to the newly created team:\nhttps://vcs.SHASTA_CLUSTER_DNS_NAME/vcs/org/cray/teams/NEWTEAM\nBackup and restore data Data for Gitea is stored in two places: Git content is stored directly in a PVC, while structural data, such as Gitea users and the list and attributes of repositories, is stored in a Postgres database. Because of this, both sources must be backed up and restored together.\nBackup Postgres data   Determine which Postgres member is the leader.\nncn# kubectl exec gitea-vcs-postgres-0 -n services -c postgres -it -- patronictl list Example output:\n+ Cluster: gitea-vcs-postgres (6995618180238446669) -----+----+-----------+ | Member | Host | Role | State | TL | Lag in MB | +----------------------+--------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+ | gitea-vcs-postgres-0 | 10.45.0.21 | Leader | running | 1 | | | gitea-vcs-postgres-1 | 10.46.128.19 | | running | 1 | 0 | | gitea-vcs-postgres-2 | 10.47.0.21 | | running | 1 | 0 | +----------------------+--------------+--------+---------+----+-----------+   Log into the leader pod and dump the data to a local file.\nncn# POSTGRES_LEADER=gitea-vcs-postgres-0 ncn# kubectl exec -it ${POSTGRES_LEADER} -n services -c postgres -- pg_dumpall -c -U postgres \u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.sql   Determine what secrets are associated with the PostgreSQL credentials:\nncn# kubectl get secrets -n services | grep gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Example output:\npostgres.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Opaque 2 13d service-account.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Opaque 2 13d standby.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials Opaque 2 13d   Export each secret to a manifest file:\nncn# SECRETS=\u0026#34;postgres service-account standby\u0026#34; ncn# echo \u0026#34;---\u0026#34; \u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.manifest ncn# for secret in $SECRETS; do kubectl get secret \u0026#34;${secret}.gitea-vcs-postgres.credentials\u0026#34; -n services -o yaml \u0026gt;\u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.manifest echo \u0026#34;---\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; gitea-vcs-postgres.manifest done   Edit the manifest file to remove creationTimestamp, resourceVersion, selfLink, and uid for each entry.\n  Copy all files to a safe location.\n  Backup PVC data The VCS Postgres backups should be accompanied by backups of the VCS PVC. The export process can be run at any time while the service is running using the following commands:\nncn-mw# POD=$(kubectl -n services get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=gitea -o json | jq -r \u0026#39;.items[] | .metadata.name\u0026#39;) ncn-mw# kubectl -n services exec ${POD} -- tar -cvf vcs.tar /data/ ncn-mw# kubectl -n services cp ${POD}:vcs.tar ./vcs.tar Be sure to save the resulting tar file to a safe location.\nRestore Postgres data See Restore Postgres for VCS.\nRestore PVC data IMPORTANT: Only do this if necessary. One does not always restore after a backup; sometimes the documentation dictates performing the backup procedure as a precautionary step.\nWhen restoring the VCS Postgres database, the PVC should also be restored to the same point in time. The restore process can be run at any time while the service is running using the following commands:\nncn-mw# POD=$(kubectl -n services get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=gitea -o json | jq -r \u0026#39;.items[] | .metadata.name\u0026#39;) ncn-mw# kubectl -n services cp ./vcs.tar ${POD}:vcs.tar ncn-mw# kubectl -n services exec ${POD} -- tar -xvf vcs.tar ncn-mw# kubectl -n services rollout restart deployment gitea-vcs Alternative backup/restore strategy An alternative to the separate backups of the Postgres and PVC data is to backup the Git data. This has the advantage that only one backup is needed and that the Git backups can be imported into any Git server, not just Gitea. This has the disadvantage that some information about the Gitea deployment is lost (such as user and organization information) and may need to be recreated manually if the VCS deployment is lost.\nThe following scripts create and use a vcs-content directory that contains all Git data. This should be copied to a safe location after export, and moved back to the system before import.\nExport  WARNING: The following example uses the VCS admin username and password in plaintext on the command line, meaning it will be stored in the shell history as well as be visible to all users on the system in the process table. These dangers can be avoided by modifying or replacing the curl command (such as supplying the credentials to curl using the --netrc-file argument instead of the --user argument, or replacing it with a simple Python script).\n ncn# RESULTS=vcs-content ncn# mkdir $RESULTS ncn# VCS_USER=$(kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials --template={{.data.vcs_username}} | base64 --decode) ncn# VCS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials --template={{.data.vcs_password}} | base64 --decode) ncn# git config --global credential.helper store ncn# echo \u0026#34;https://${VCS_USER}:${VCS_PASSWORD}@api-gw-service-nmn.local\u0026#34; \u0026gt; ~/.git-credentials ncn# for repo in $(curl -s https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/api/v1/orgs/cray/repos --user ${VCS_USER}:${VCS_PASSWORD}| jq -r \u0026#39;.[] | .name\u0026#39;) ; do git clone --mirror https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/${repo}.git cd ${repo}.git git bundle create ${repo}.bundle --all cp ${repo}.bundle ../$RESULTS cd .. rm -r $repo.git done Import ncn# SOURCE=vcs-content ncn# VCS_USER=$(kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials --template={{.data.vcs_username}} | base64 --decode) ncn# VCS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials --template={{.data.vcs_password}} | base64 --decode) ncn# git config --global credential.helper store ncn# echo \u0026#34;https://${VCS_USER}:${VCS_PASSWORD}@api-gw-service-nmn.local\u0026#34; \u0026gt; ~/.git-credentials ncn# for file in $(ls $SOURCE); do repo=$(echo $file | sed \u0026#39;s/.bundle$//\u0026#39;) git clone --mirror ${SOURCE}/${repo}.bundle cd ${repo}.git git remote set-url origin https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/${repo}.git git push cd .. rm -r ${repo}.git done Prior to import, the repository structure may need to be recreated if it has not already been by an install.\nAdjust the repository list as necessary, if any additional repositories are present.

	"content": "Write Ansible Code for CFS Cray provides Ansible plays and roles for software products deemed necessary for the system to function. Customers are free to write their own Ansible plays and roles to augment what Cray provides or implement new features. Basic knowledge of Ansible is needed to write plays and roles. The information below includes recommendations and best practices for writing and running Ansible code on the system successfully with the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).\nHelp with Ansible can be found in the external Ansible documentation:\n Ansible playbook best practices Ansible examples  Ansible Code Structure The Version Control Service (VCS) is setup during the Cray System Management (CSM) product installation, which is the appropriate place to store configuration content. Individual product installations include the Ansible code to properly configure each product.\nThe structure of the individual repository directories matches the recommended directory layout from the external Ansible documentation. The default playbook site.yml is found at the top level, if it exists, and the Ansible roles and variables are in their appropriate directories. Inventory directories like group_vars and host_vars may exist, but they are empty and left for variable overrides and customizations by the user.\nWrite Playbooks for Multiple Node Types Within an Ansible playbook, users can designate which node groups the various tasks and roles will run against. For example, a default site.yml playbook may contain a list of roles that are run on only the Compute nodes, and a list of roles that will run on only Application nodes. This is designated using the hosts parameter.\nFor example, hosts: Compute would be used to target the compute nodes. Users can create additional sections that target other node types, or adjust the hosts that the included roles will run against as necessary. It is also possible to target multiple groups within a section of a playbook, or to specify complex targets, such as nodes that are in one group and not in another group. The syntax for this is available in the external Ansible documentation. Hosts can be in more than one group at a time if there are user-defined groups. In this case, Ansible will run all sections that match the node type against the node.\nSee the Ansible Inventory section for more information about groups that are made automatically available through CFS dynamic inventory.\nPerformance and Scaling Tips CFS will handle scaling up Ansible to run on many hosts, but there are still places where performance can be improved by correctly writing Ansible plays.\n Use image customization when possible to limit how many times a task is run and improve boot times. Configuration that is the same for all nodes of the same type will benefit from image customization. See the next section for how to target specific tasks for running only during image customization. Import roles rather than playbooks. Each time a new playbook starts, Ansible automatically gathers facts for all the systems it is running against. This is not necessary more than once and can slow down Ansible execution. Turn off facts that are not needed in a playbook by setting gather_facts: false. If only a few facts are required, it is also possible to limit fact gathering by setting gather_subset. For more information on gather_subset, see the external Ansible module setup documentation. Use loops rather than individual tasks where modules are called multiple times. Some Ansible modules will optimize the command, such as grouping package installations into a single transaction (Refer to the external Ansible playbook loops documentation).  "

	"content": "Specifying Hosts and Groups When using the Configuration Framework Service (CFS), there are many steps where users may need to specify the hosts that CFS should configure. This can be done by specifying individual hosts, or groups of hosts. There are several places where a user may need to provide this information, particularly groups, and depending on where this information is provided, the behavior can change greatly.\nInventories CFS has multiple options for generating inventories, but regardless of which option is used, the information is then converted into an Ansible inventory/hosts file. The inventory is the list of components that Ansible can run against. Anything not in the inventory is unknown to Ansible. Components in an inventory can be placed into groups so that they can be easily referenced together either in the Ansible code or when providing a limit to CFS.\nFor more information on Ansible inventory, see the official Ansible Inventory Documentation.\nHosts Within Ansible plays, it is possible to target different hosts and groups. These hosts and groups must exist in the inventory when Ansible is run. Combined with the inventory, this will determine which hosts have tasks run. For more information, see the Ansible Hosts Documentation.\nLimits The limit parameter is a way of restricting a run to a smaller set of hosts. Users can specify hosts or groups, or combinations of the two, but no new information can be added at this point. Hosts or groups that do not appear in the inventory will still not be configured, and likewise it is not possible to change the behavior of any parts of the play. Ansible will target the same groups for each task that it would have before, but now with a more limited inventory.\n"

	"content": "Target Ansible Tasks for Image Customization The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) enables Ansible playbooks to run against both running nodes and images. See the \u0026ldquo;Use Cases\u0026rdquo; header in the Configuration Management section for more information about image customization and when it should be used.\nCFS uses the cray_cfs_image variable to distinguish between node personalization (running on live nodes) and image customization (configuring an image prior to boot). When this variable is set to true, it indicates that the CFS session is an image customization type and the playbook is targeting an image.\nCFS automatically sets this variable in the hosts/01-cfs-generated.yaml file for all sessions. When the session target is image customization, it sets cray_cfs_image to true; otherwise, it is false.\ncray_cfs_image can be set with Ansible playbook conditionals to selectively run individual tasks with when: cray_cfs_image, or to ignore individual tasks with when: not cray_cfs_image.\nConditionals can also be applied to entire roles if desired (see the external apply Ansible conditionals to roles). In instances where the same playbook may be run in both modes, it is best practice to include a conditional on all parts of the playbook, or at least those that take significant time so that work is not duplicated.\nIt is also best practice to include a default in Ansible roles for playbook and role portability because CFS injects this variable at runtime. This can be done in the defaults section of the role, or where the variable is called. For example:\nwhen: \u0026#34;{{ cray_cfs_image | default(false) }}\u0026#34; If a default is not provided, any playbooks or roles will not be runnable outside of the CFS Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) without the user specifying cray_cfs_image in the vars files or with the Ansible extra-vars options.\nWhen running Ansible against an IMS-hosted image root during an image customization CFS session, there are no special requirements for the paths when copying or syncing files. The image root directories will appears as if Ansible is connecting to a regular, live node. However, the image is not a running node, so actions that require a running system, such as starting/reloading a service, will not work properly and will cause the Ansible play to fail. Actions like these should be done only during live-node configuration modes such as node personalization.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Create an Image Customization CFS Session A configuration session that is meant to customize image roots tracked by the Image Management Service (IMS) can be created using the --target-definition image option. This option will instruct the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) to prepare the image IDs specified and assign them to the groups specified in Ansible inventory. IMS will then provide SSH connection information to each image root that CFS will use to configure Ansible.\nAlong with the --target-definition option, users must also provide the --target-group option. This option can be provided multiple times, and allows users to specify the Ansible inventory by creating multiple groups within the inventory and the image(s) that should be in each group. It is important to note that users provide the entire inventory when using image customization, and groups that are not specified will not be included, even if they appear in other CFS inventory types, such as dynamic inventory. For more information on what it means to provide the inventory, see Specifying Hosts and Groups.\nUsers can expect that staging the image and generating an inventory will be a longer process than creating a session with other target definitions (for example, inventories). Tearing down the configuration session will also require additional time while IMS packages up the image build artifacts and uploads them to the artifact repository.\nIn order to use the image target definition, an image must be registered with the IMS.

	"title": "Customize Configuration Values",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Customize Configuration Values In general, most systems will require some customization from the default values provided by Cray products. As stated in the previous section, these changes cannot be made on the pristine product branches that are imported during product installation and upgrades. Changes can only be made in Git branches that are based on the pristine branches.\nChanging or overriding default values should be done in accordance with Ansible best practices (see the external Ansible best practices guide) and variable precedence (see the external Ansible variable guide) in mind.\nThe following practices should also be followed:\n When it is necessary to add more functionality beyond an Ansible playbook provided by a Cray product, include the product playbook in a new playbook instead of modifying it directly. Any modifications to a product playbook will result in a merge being required during a product upgrade. Do not modify default Ansible role variables, override all values using inventory (group_vars and host_vars directories). Cray products do not import any content to inventory locations, so merges of new product content will not cause conflicts if variables are located in inventory. Do not put any sensitive or secret information, such as passwords, in the Git repository. These values should be pulled during runtime from an external key management system.  Handling Sensitive Information Passwords and other sensitive content should not be stored in a Version Control Service (VCS) repository. Instead, consider writing Ansible tasks/roles that pull the value in dynamically while the playbook is running from an external secrets management system.\nAt this time, the Ansible Vault is not supported by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).\nExample: Override a Role Default Value To override a value that is defined in an Ansible role in a configuration repository, set the value in the Ansible inventory. If the override pertains to an entire Ansible group of nodes, create a file as follows:\n  Clone the configuration repository.\n  Checkout the branch that will include the change, or create a new branch.\n  Capture the variable name in the roles/[role name]/defaults/main.yml file.\n  Create a new directory and edit a file with the role name.\nncn# mkdir -p group_vars/all \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch group_vars/all/[role name].yml   Set the variable to a new value in the file.\nncn# echo \u0026#39;[variable name]: [new variable value]\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; group_vars/all/[role name].yml   Stage the file in the Git branch, commit it, and promote the change.\n  This change will be applied to all nodes by using the group name all. To narrow the variable scope to a specific group (Compute for example), use the group name instead of all as follows:\nncn# mkdir -p group_vars/Compute \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch group_vars/Compute/[role name].yml ncn# echo \u0026#39;[variable name]: [new variable value]\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; group_vars/Compute/[role name].yml To narrow the variable scope to a single node create the file in the host_vars/[node xname]/[role name].yaml and override the value.\nThe name of the created file is largely inconsequential. The identified best practice is to include the name of the role in the created file for reasons of maintainability and discoverability. However, be aware that the file name matters when multiple files in the same directory contain the same variable with different values. In that case, use a single all.yml file rather than a directory, or use files names with import ordering in mind. See the external Ansible documentation for more information on how variables precedence is handled.\nTo override role variables for roles that exist across multiple repositories, consider using the CFS Additional Inventory feature. See Manage Multiple Inventories in a Single Location.\nExample: Add or Remove Functionality to a Provided Playbook To add more functionality to a playbook provided by a configuration repository, it is considered best practice to leave the existing playbook unmodified (if possible) to not have merge conflicts when new versions of the playbook are installed. For instance, if a site.yml playbook needs to be extended with a custom site-custom.yml playbook, consider creating a new playbook that imports and runs them both. For example, the site-all.yml playbook.\nncn# cat site-all.yml - import_playbook: site.yml - import_playbook: site-custom.yml See the external Ansible documentation on re-using playbooks.\nTo remove a role from a provided playbook, the best practice is to determine if the role provides a variable to skip the roles tasks altogether. See the roles/[role name]/README file for a listing of the role variables.\nIf changes to role variables are not able to skip the role, the role may be commented out in the playbook. However, note that an upgrade to the configuration will result in a merge conflict because of the changes made in the playbook if the upgrade pristine branch is merged with the branch containing the commented playbook.\n"

When values for each of these layers need to be customized, it can be tedious to override values in each of the respective repositories. The CFS additionalInventoryUrl option allows for static inventory files to be automatically added to the hosts directory of each configuration layer before it is applied by Ansible. It is then possible to add this additional Ansible inventory information to all configuration sessions so it can be used simultaneously with other inventory types, including the CFS dynamic inventory type, across all configuration layers in a session.\nThe additionalInventoryUrl option is optional and is set on a global CFS level. If provided, it must be set to the URL of a Git repository containing inventory files in the base directory of the repository. For ordering purposes, any inventory generated by CFS will also be placed in this directory with the name 01-cfs-generated.yaml.

	"content": "Set Limits for a Configuration Session The configuration layers and session hosts can be limited when running a Configuration Framework Service (CFS) session.\nLimit CFS Session Hosts Subsets of nodes can be targeted in the inventory when running CFS sessions, which is useful specifically when running a session with dynamic inventory. Use the CFS --ansible-limit option when creating a session to apply the limits. The option directly corresponds to the --limit option offered by ansible-playbook, and can be used to specify hosts, groups, or combinations of them with patterns. CFS passes the value of this option directly to the ansible-playbook command for each configuration layer in the session. See the Ansible documentation on Patterns: targeting hosts and groups.\nIMPORTANT: The --limit option is useful for temporarily limiting the scope of targets for a configuration session. For example, it could be used to target a subset of the Compute group that has been separated for development use. However it should not be used to limit an Ansible playbook to target only the nodes that the playbook is intended to use. If a playbook should only be run on a specific group, target the proper group(s) with the hosts: section of the Ansible playbook.\nSee Using Ansible Limits for more information about limiting hosts and groups in playbooks.\nUse the following command to create a CFS session to run on all hosts in the Compute group, but not a previously defined dev group:\nncn# cray cfs sessions create --name example \\ --configuration-name configurations-example \\ --ansible-limit \u0026#39;Compute:!dev\u0026#39; { \u0026#34;ansible\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cfs-default-ansible-cfg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;limit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Compute:!dev\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;verbosity\u0026#34;: 0 }, \u0026#34;configuration\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;limit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;configurations-example\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;artifacts\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pending\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;succeeded\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;none\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;definition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dynamic\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groups\u0026#34;: null } } Limit CFS Session Configuration Layers It is possible to limit the session to only specific layers of the configuration that is specified. This is useful when re-applying configuration of a specific layer and applying the other layers is not necessary or desired. This option may also reduce the number of configurations that need to be created and stored by CFS because sessions can specify layers from a master configuration layer list.\nUse the --configuration-limit option when creating a CFS session to apply configuration layer limits. Multiple layers to limit the session are specified as a comma-separated list either by name (if layers were given names when created) or by zero-based index as defined in the configuration submitted to CFS.\nUse the following command to create a CFS session to run only on example-layer1, and then example-layer5 of a previously created configurations-example configuration:\nWARNING: If the configuration\u0026rsquo;s layers do not have names, then indices must be specified.

This includes nodes available in the Hardware State Manager (HSM) inventory (compute, management, and application nodes), and boot images hosted by the Image Management Service (IMS).\nCFS configures nodes and images via a gitops methodology. All configuration content is stored in a version control service (VCS), and is managed by authorized system administrators. CFS provides a scalable Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) for the configuration to be applied with flexible inventory and node targeting options.\nWARNING: CFS is not fully supported for storage nodes in this release.\nUse Cases CFS is available for the following use cases on systems:\n Image customization: Pre-configure bootable images available via IMS. This use case enables partitioning a full configuration of a target node. Non-node-specific settings are applied pre-boot, which reduces the amount of configuration required after a node boots, and therefore reduces the bring-up time for nodes. Post-boot configuration: Fully configure or reconfigure booted nodes in a scalable, performant way to add the required settings. \u0026ldquo;Push-based\u0026rdquo; deployment: When using post-boot configuration with only node-specific configuration data, the target undergoes node personalization. The two-step process of pre-boot image customization and post-boot node personalization results in a fully configured node, optimized for minimal bring-up times. \u0026ldquo;Pull-based\u0026rdquo; deployment: Provide configuration management to nodes by prescribing a desired configuration state and ensuring the current node configuration state matches the desired state automatically. This is achieved via the CFS Hardware Synchronization Agent and the CFS Batcher implementation.  CFS Components CFS is comprised of a group of services and components interacting within the Cray System Management (CSM) service mesh, and provides a means for system administrators to configure nodes and boot images via Ansible. CFS includes the following components:\n A REST API service. A command-line interface (CLI) to the API (via the cray cfs command). Pre-packaged AEE(s) with values tuned for performant configuration for executing Ansible playbooks, and reporting plug-ins for communication with CFS. The CFS Hardware Sync Agent, which pulls in node information from the system inventory to the CFS database to track the node configuration state. The CFS Batcher, which manages the configuration state of system components (nodes).  Although it is not a formal part of the service, CFS integrates with a Gitea instance (VCS) running in the CSM service mesh for management of the configuration content life-cycle.\nHigh-Level Configuration Workflow CFS remotely executes Ansible configuration content on nodes or boot images with the following workflow:\n Creating a configuration with one or more layers within a specific Git repository, and committing it to be executed by Ansible. Targeting a node, boot image, or group of nodes to apply the configuration. Creating a configuration session to apply and track the status of Ansible, applying each configuration layer to the targets specified in the session metadata.  Additionally, configuration management of specific components (nodes) can also be achieved by doing the following:\n Creating a configuration with one or more layers within a specific Git repository, and committing it to be executed by Ansible. Setting the desired configuration state of a node to the prescribed layers. Enabling the CFS Batcher to automatically configure nodes by creating one or more configuration sessions to apply the configuration layer(s).  "

	"content": "Configuration Management of System Components The configuration of individual system components is managed with the cray cfs components command. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) contains a database of the configuration state of available hardware known to the Hardware State Manager (HSM). When new nodes are added to the HSM database, a CFS Hardware Sync Agent enters the component into the CFS database with a null state of configuration.\nAdministrators are able to set a desired CFS configuration for each component, and the CFS Batcher ensures the desired configuration state and the current configuration state match.\nAutomatic Configuration Whenever CFS detects that the desired configuration does not match the current configuration state, CFS Batcher will automatically start a CFS session to apply the necessary configuration. See Configuration Management with CFS Batcher for more information.\nThere are several situations that will cause automatic configuration:\n When rebooted, components that have the cfs-state-reporter package installed will register a null current configuration, resulting in a full configuration. When a configuration is updated, all components with that desired configuration will automatically get updates for the layers of the configuration that have changed. If a configuration is only partially applied because of a previous failed configuration session and the component has not exceeded its maximum retries, it will be configured with any layers of the configurations that have not yet been successfully applied. When a user manually resets the configuration state of a component, it will force reconfiguration without rebooting a node. If a manual CFS session applies a version of a playbook that conflicts with the version in the desired configuration, CFS will re-apply the desired version after the manual session is completed. Any other situation that causes the desired state to not match with the current state of a component will trigger automatic configuration. CFS only tracks the current state of components as they are configured by CFS sessions. It does not track configuration state created or modified by other tooling on the system.  View Component Configuration Configuration status of a given component (using the component name (xname)) is available through the cray cfs components describe command. The following fields are provided to determine the status and state of the component:\n  configurationStatus\nThe status of the component\u0026rsquo;s configuration. Valid status values are unconfigured, failed, pending, and configured.\n  desiredConfig\nThe CFS configurations entry assigned to this component.\n  enabled\nIndicates whether the component will be configured by CFS or not.\n  errorCount\nThe number of times configuration sessions have failed to configure this component.\n  retryPolicy\nThe number of times the configuration will be attempted if it fails.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Configuration Management with the CFS Batcher Creating configuration sessions with the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) enables remote execution for configuring live nodes and boot images prior to booting. CFS also provides its Batcher component for configuration management of registered system components. The CFS Batcher periodically examines the aggregated configuration state of registered components and schedules CFS sessions against those that have not been configured to their desired state. The frequency of scheduling, the maximum number of components to schedule in the same CFS session, and the expiration time for scheduling less than full sessions are configurable.\nThe CFS-Batcher schedules CFS sessions according to the following rules:\n  Components are assigned to a batch if they need configuration, are not disabled, and are currently not assigned to a batch.\n Components are grouped according to their desired state information. A new batch is created if no partial batches match the desired state, and all similar batches are full.    Batches are scheduled as CFS sessions when the batch is full or the batch window time has been exceeded.\n The timer for the batch window is started when the first component is added, and is never reset. Nodes should never wait more than the window period between being ready for configuration and being scheduled in a CFS session.    CFS cannot guarantee that jobs for similar batches will start at the same time, even if all CFS sessions are created at the same time. This variability is due to the nature of Kubernetes scheduling.\n Checking the start time for the CFS session is more accurate than checking the pod start time when determining when a batch was scheduled.    There are two safety mechanisms built into the Batcher scheduling that can delay batches more than the usual amount of time. Both mechanisms are indicated in the logs:\n  CFS Batcher will not schedule multiple sessions to configure the same component. Batcher monitors on-going sessions that it started so that if one session is started and the desired configuration changes, Batcher can wait until the initial session is completed before scheduling the component with the new configuration to a new session.\n If Batcher is restarted, it will attempt to rebuild its state based on sessions with the \u0026ldquo;batcher-\u0026rdquo; naming scheme that are still in progress. This ensures that scheduling conflicts will not occur even if Batcher is restarted. On restart, some information on the in-flight sessions is lost, so this wait ensures that the Batcher does not schedule multiple configuration sessions for the same component at the same time.    If several CFS sessions that are created by the Batcher Agent fail in a row (the most recent 20 sessions), Batcher will start throttling the creation of new sessions.\n The throttling is automatically reset if a single session succeeds. Users can also manually reset this by restarting Batcher. The back-off is increased if new sessions continue to fail. This helps protect against cases where high numbers of retries are allowed so that Batcher cannot flood Kubernetes with new jobs in a short period of time.    Configure Batcher Several Batcher behaviors are configurable. All of the Batcher configuration is available through the CFS options:\n# cray cfs options list | grep -i batch batchSize = 25 batchWindow = 60 batcherCheckInterval = 10 defaultBatcherRetryPolicy = 3 See CFS Global Options for more information. Use the cray cfs options update command to change these values as needed.\nReview the following information about CFS Batcher options before changing the defaults. Setting these to non-optimal values may affect system performance. The optimal values will depend on system size and the specifics of the configuration layers that will be applied in the sessions created by CFS Batcher.\n  batchSize\nThis option determines the maximum number of components that will be included in each session created by CFS Batcher.\nThe default value is 25 components per session.\nWARNING: Increasing this value will result in fewer batcher-created sessions, but will also require more resources for Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) containers to do the configuration.\n  batchWindow\nThis option sets the number of seconds that CFS batcher will wait before scheduling a CFS session when the number of components needing configuration has not reached the batchSize limit. CFS Batcher will immediately create a session when the batchSize limit is reached. However, in the case where there are few components or long periods of time between components notifying CFS Batcher of the need for configuration, the batchWindow will time-box the creation of sessions so no component needs to wait for the queue to fill.\nThe default value is 60 seconds.\nWARNING: Lower values will cause CFS Batcher to be more responsive to creating sessions, but values too low may result in degraded performance of both the CFS APIs as well as the overall system.\n  batcherCheckInterval\nThis option sets how often CFS batcher checks for components waiting to be configured. This value must be lower than batchWindow value.\nThe default value is 10 seconds.\nWARNING: Lower values will cause CFS Batcher to be more responsive to creating sessions, but values too low may result in degraded performance of the CFS APIs on larger systems.\n  defaultBatcherRetryPolicy\nWhen a component (node) requiring configuration fails to configure from a previous configuration session launched by CFS Batcher, the error is logged. defaultBatcherRetryPolicy is the maximum number of failed configurations allowed per component before CFS Batcher will stop attempts to configure the component.\nThis value can be overridden on a per component basis.\n  List CFS Batcher Sessions The CFS Batcher prepends all CFS session names it creates with batcher-. Sessions that have be created by CFS Batcher are found by using the following command with the --name-contains option:\n# cray cfs sessions list --name-contains batcher- To list the batcher sessions that are currently running, filter with the cray cfs sessions list command options:\n# cray cfs sessions list --name-contains batcher- --status running Use the cray cfs sessions list --help command output for all filtering options, including session age, tags, status, and success.\nMap CFS Batcher Sessions to BOS Sessions To find all of the sessions created by the CFS Batcher because of configuration requests made by a specific Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session, filter the sessions by the name of the BOS session, which is added as a tag on the sessions. The BOS session ID is required to run the following command.\n# cray cfs sessions list --tags bos_session=BOS_SESSION_ID "

	"content": "Configuration Sessions Once configurations have been created with the required layers and values set in the configuration repositories (or the additional inventory repository), create a Configuration Framework Session (CFS) session to apply the configuration to the targets.\nSessions are created via the Cray CLI or through the CFS REST API. A session stages Ansible inventory (whether dynamic, static, or image customization), launches Ansible Execution Environments (AEE) in order for each configuration layer in the service mesh, tears down the environments as required, and reports the session status to the CFS API.\nWhen a session target is an Image Management Service (IMS) image ID for the purposes of pre-boot image customization, the CFS session workflow varies slightly. The inventory staging instead calls IMS to expose the requested image root(s) via SSH. After the AEE(s) finish applying the configuration layers, CFS then instructs IMS to tear down the image root environment and package up the resultant image and records the new image ID in the session metadata.\nSession Naming Conventions CFS follows the same naming conventions for session names as Kubernetes does for jobs. Session names must follow the Kubernetes naming conventions and are limited to 45 characters.\nRefer to the external Kubernetes naming conventions documentation for more information.\nConfiguration Session Filters CFS provides several filters for use when listing sessions or using the bulk delete option. These following filters are available:\n  --status - Session status options include pending, running, and complete.\n  --succeeded - If the session has not yet completed, this will be set to none. Otherwise, this will be set to true, false, or unknown in the event that CFS was unable to find the Kubernetes job associated with the session.\n  --min-age/--max-age - Returns only the sessions that fall within the given age. For example, --max-age could be used to list only the recent sessions, or --min-age could be used to find old sessions for cleanup. Age is given in the format \u0026ldquo;1d\u0026rdquo; for days, or \u0026ldquo;6h\u0026rdquo; for hours.\n  --tags - Sessions can be created with searchable tags. By default, this includes the bos_session tag when CFS is triggered by BOS. This can be searched using the following command:\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions list --tags bos_session=BOS_SESSION_NAME   Configuration Session Workflow CFS progresses through a session by running a series of commands in containers located in a Kubernetes job pod. Four container types are present in the job pod which pertain to CFS session setup, execution, and teardown:\n  git-clone-*\nThese init containers are responsible for cloning the configuration repository and checking out the branch/commit specified in each configuration layer.\nThese containers are run in the same order as the layers are specified, and their names are indexed appropriately: git-clone-0, git-clone-1, and so on.\n  git-clone-hosts\nThis init container clones the repository specified in the parameter additionalInventoryUrl, if specified.\n  inventory\nThis container is responsible for generating the dynamic inventory or for communicating to IMS to stage boot image roots that need to be made available via SSH when the session --target-definition is image.\n  ansible-*\nThese containers run the AEE after CFS injects the inventory and Git repository content from previous containers. One container is executed for each configuration layer specified.\nThese containers are run in the same order as the layers are specified, and their names are indexed appropriately: ansible-0, ansible-1, and so on.\n  teardown\nThis container waits for the last ansible-* to complete and subsequently calls IMS to package up customized image roots. The container only exists when the session --target-definition is image.\n  "

	"content": "Ansible Inventory The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) provides several options for targeting nodes or boot images for configuration by Ansible. The contents of the Ansible inventory determine which nodes are available for configuration in each CFS session and how default configuration values can be customized. For more information on what it means to define an inventory, see Specifying Hosts and Groups.\nThe following are the inventory options provided by CFS:\n Dynamic inventory Static inventory Image Customization  Dynamic Inventory and Host Groups Dynamic inventory is the default inventory when creating a CFS session. CFS automatically generates an Ansible hosts file with data provided by the Hardware State Manager (HSM) when using a dynamic inventory. CFS automatically generates Ansible hosts groups for each group defined in HSM and creates Ansible host groups for nodes based on hardware roles and sub-roles.\nRetrieve a list of HSM groups with the following command:\nncn# cray hsm groups list --format json | jq .[].label \u0026#34;example-group1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;example-group2\u0026#34; These groups can be referenced in Ansible plays or when creating a CFS session directly.\nHardware roles and sub-roles are available as [Role] and [Role]_[Subrole] Ansible host groups. For instance, if targeting just the nodes with the \u0026ldquo;Application\u0026rdquo; role, the host group name is Application. If targeting just the sub-role \u0026ldquo;UAN\u0026rdquo;, which is a sub-role of the \u0026ldquo;Application\u0026rdquo; role, the host group name provided by CFS is Application_UAN. See HSM Roles and Subroles for more information.\nConsult the cray-hms-base-config Kubernetes ConfigMap in the services namespace for a listing of the available roles and sub-roles on the system.\nDuring a CFS session, the dynamic inventory is generated and placed in the hosts/01-cfs-generated.yaml file, relative to the configuration management repository root defined in the current configuration layer. Refer to the external Ansible Inventory documentation for more information about managing inventory, as well as variable precedence within multiple inventory files.\nCFS prefixes its dynamic inventory file with 01- so that its variables can be easily overridden as needed because Ansible reads inventory files in lexicographic order.\nStatic Inventory It is also possible for users to bypass HSM and specify their own hosts and groups using a static inventory file. This replaces the dynamic inventory, so each host and group that is going to be targeted must be listed in an inventory file by the user. This approach is useful for testing configuration changes on a small scale.\nCreate a static inventory file in a hosts directory at the root of the configuration management repository in Ansible INI format. For example, create it in a branch and persist the changes.\nIn the following example, this is done for a single node in static inventory:\nncn# mkdir -p hosts; cd hosts; cat \u0026gt; static \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF [test_nodes] x3000c0s25b0n0 EOF ncn# cd ..; git add hosts/static ncn# git commit -m \u0026#34;Added a single test node to static inventory\u0026#34; ncn# git push The process can be used to include any nodes in the system reachable over the Node Management Network (NMN), which contains the public SSH key pair provisioned by the install process. This inventory information will only be located in the repository to which it is added. If the desired configuration contains multiple layers, use the additionalInventoryUrl option in CFS to provide inventory information on a per-session level instead of a per-repository level. Refer to Manage Multiple Inventories in a Single Location for more information.\nImage Customization Inventory for image customization is also provided by the user. This type of configuration session does not target live nodes, so HSM has no knowledge of either the host or the groups it belongs to. Instead, when creating a configuration session meant to customize a boot image, the Image Management Service (IMS) image IDs are used as hosts and grouped according to user input to the session creation.\nSee Create an Image Customization CFS Session for more information.\n"

A user creates a CFS session, causing a session record to be created. When a session record is created, the CFS-API also posts an event to a Kafka queue. The CFS-Operator is always monitoring the Kafka queue, and handles events as they come in. The CFS-Operator creates a Kubernetes job for the session in response to a session creation event. The CFS-Operator monitors the Kubernetes job (not the pod) for completion. When the Kubernetes job is complete, the CFS-Operator updates the session record in the CFS-API.  Automated Session Flow This section covers the components and actions taken when a user or service sets a desired configuration for a component, causing automatic configuration to occur.\n A user creates a CFS configuration. A user sets the desired configuration for some number of components. This may immediately trigger configuration if the component is enabled in CFS and the desired configuration has not yet been applied. If that is the case, then skip to step 4. When a node reboots, the CFS-State-Reporter runs on the node, and contacts the CFS-API to enable and clear the state for the current node. This will always trigger the next steps for configuration as long as a desired configuration is set for the node. The CFS-Batcher monitors the CFS-API, periodically querying for enabled components with a pending configuration status. (The status is determined by the API at query time based on the desired and current state of the component). Any components found are placed into batches. The CFS-Batcher calls the CFS-API to create sessions for each batch, using the ansible-limit parameter to limit each session to the components in a batch. The CFS-API creates a session record and session creation event. See Single Session Flow for details. The CFS-Operator monitors for session creation events. See Single Session Flow for details. The CFS-Operator creates a Kubernetes job. See Single Session Flow for details. The Ansible Execution Environment contains a custom Ansible plugin that calls CFS to update the status of all components affected after each play. If the component does not have a configured status due to failure or other reasons, return to step 4.  "

Upgrade the node. Reboot the node into the upgraded state. Return the node to service within its respective workload manager.  CRUS enables administrators to limit the impact on production caused from upgrading compute nodes by working through one step of the upgrade process at a time. The nodes in each step are first taken out of service in the workload manager to prevent work from being scheduled. They are then upgraded, rebooted, and put back into service in the workload manager.\nCRUS is built upon a few basic features of the system:\n The grouping of nodes by label provided by the Hardware State Manager (HSM) groups mechanism.

It will be removed in a future CSM release and replaced with BOS V2, which will provide similar functionality.\nThe following workflow is intended to be a high-level overview of how to upgrade compute nodes. This workflow depicts how services interact with each other during the compute node upgrade process, and helps to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nUse cases Administrator upgrades select compute nodes to a newer compute image by using Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS).\nRequirements  The compute nodes are up and running. Compute node workloads are managed by Slurm.  Components This workflow is based on the interaction of CRUS with Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) and Slurm (Workload Manager).\nThe following terms are mentioned in this workflow:\n Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) allows an administrator to modify the boot image and/or configuration on a set of compute nodes without the need to take the entire set of nodes out of service at once. It manages the workload management status of nodes, quiescing each node before taking the node out of service, upgrading the node, rebooting the node into the upgraded state and then returning the node to service within the workload manager. Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. The Boot Orchestration Service has the following components:  Boot Orchestration Session Template is a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and parameters. Boot Orchestration Session carries out an operation. The possible operations in a session are boot, shutdown, reboot, and configure. Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) is automatically launched to execute the session. A BOA executes the given operation, and if the operation is a boot or a reboot, it also configures the nodes post-boot (if configure is enabled).   The Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) is the central management daemon of Slurm. It runs on non-compute nodes in a container. It monitors all other Slurm daemons and resources, accepts jobs, and allocates resources to those jobs. The Slurm daemon (slurmd) monitors all tasks running on compute nodes, accepts tasks, launches tasks, and kills running tasks upon request. It runs on compute nodes.  Workflow The following sequence of steps occur during this workflow.\n1. Administrator creates HSM groups and populates the starting group   Create three HSM groups with starting, failed, and upgrading labels.\nAny names can be used for these groups. For this example: crus_starting, crusfailed, and crusupgrading, respectively.\n  Add all of the compute nodes to be updated to the crus_starting group.\nLeave the crusfailed, and crusupgrading groups empty.\n  2. Administrator creates a session template A session template is a collection of metadata for a group of nodes and their desired configuration.\nCreate a BOS session template which points to the new image, the desired CFS configuration, and with a boot set which includes all the compute nodes to be updated. The boot set can include additional nodes, but it must contain all the nodes that need to be updated. The BOS session template should specify crusupgrading in the node_groups field of one of its boot sets.\nThis example will use the BOS session template named newcomputetemplate.\n3. Administrator creates a CRUS session A new upgrade session is launched as a result of this call.\nSpecify the following parameters:\n   Parameter Example Meaning     failed_label crusfailed An empty Hardware State Manager (HSM) group which CRUS will populate with any nodes that fail their upgrades.   starting_label crus_starting An HSM group which contains the total set of nodes to be upgraded.   upgrading_label crusupgrading An empty HSM group which CRUS will use to boot and configure subsets of the compute nodes.   upgradestepsize 50 The number of nodes to include in each discrete upgrade step.*   upgradetemplateid newcomputetemplate The name of the BOS session template to use for the upgrades.   workloadmanagertype slurm Only Slurm is supported.     * Each group of concurrent upgrades will never exceed this number of compute nodes, although in some cases they may be smaller.\n 4. CRUS to HSM CRUS calls HSM to find the nodes in the crus_starting group.\n5. CRUS to HSM CRUS selects a number of these nodes equal to upgradestepsize and calls HSM to put them into the crusupgrading group.\n6. CRUS to Slurm CRUS tells Slurm to quiesce these nodes. As each node is quiesced, Slurm puts the node offline.\n7. Slurm to CRUS Slurm reports back to CRUS that all of the nodes as offline.\n8. CRUS to BOS CRUS calls BOS to create a session with the following arguments:\n   Parameter Value     operation reboot   templateUuid newcomputetemplate   limit crusupgrading    9. CRUS retrieves the BOA job details from BOS   CRUS retrieves the BOS session to get the BOA job name.\n  CRUS waits for the BOA job to finish.\n  CRUS looks at the exit code of the BOA job to determine whether or not there were errors.\nIf there were errors, CRUS adds the nodes from the crusupgrading group into the crusfailed group.\n  CRUS calls HSM to empty the crusupgrading group.\n  10. CRUS repeats steps for remaining nodes, then updates status   CRUS repeats steps 5-9 until all of the nodes from the crus_starting group have gone through these steps.\n  CRUS marks the session status as complete.\n  "

	"content": "Troubleshoot Compute Node Boot Issues Using Kubernetes A number of Kubernetes commands can be used to debug issues related to the node boot process. All of the traffic bound for the DHCP server, TFTP server, and Boot Script Service (BSS) is sent on the Node Management Network (NMN).\nIn the current arrangement, all three services are located on a non-compute node (NCN). Thus, traffic must first travel through the NCN to reach these services inside their pods. When attempting to track down missing requests for either DHCP or TFTP, it is helpful to set up tcpdump on the NCN where the pod is resident to ensure that the request got that far. The NODE column in the output of kubectl get pods -o wide shows which node the pod is running on.\nTroubleshooting Tips   Retrieve logs for a specific Kubernetes pod:\nSyntax:\nncn-m001# kubectl logs -n NAMESPACE pod_name Example:\nncn-m001# kubectl get pods -n services -o wide|grep -E \u0026#34;NAME|kea\u0026#34; NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES cray-dhcp-kea-6b78789fc4-lzmff 3/3 Running 0 5d12h 10.42.0.30 ncn-w002 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; ncn-m001# kubectl logs -n services DHCP_KEA_POD_ID -c CONTAINER DHCPDISCOVER from a4:bf:01:23:1a:f4 via vlan100 ICMP Echo reply while lease 10.100.160.199 valid.

	"content": "Troubleshoot UAN Boot Issues Use this topic to guide troubleshooting of UAN boot issues.\nThe UAN boot process BOS boots UANs. BOS uses session templates to define various parameters such as:\n Which nodes to boot Which image to boot Kernel parameters Whether to perform post-boot configuration (Node Personalization) of the nodes by CFS. Which CFS configuration to use if Node Personalization is enabled.  UAN boots are performed in three phases:\n PXE booting an iPXE binary that will load the initrd of the wanted UAN image to boot. Booting the initrd (dracut) image which configures the UAN for booting the UAN image. This process consists of two phases.  Configuring the UAN node to use the Content Projection Service (CPS) and Data Virtualization Service (DVS). These services manage the UAN image rootfs mounting and make that image available to the UAN nodes. Mounting the rootfs   Booting the UAN image rootfs.  PXE Issues Most failures to PXE are the result of misconfigured network switches and/or BIOS settings. The UAN must PXE boot over the Node Management Network (NMN) and the switches must be configured to allow connectivity to the NMN. The cable for the NMN must be connected to the first port of the OCP card on HPE DL325 and DL385 nodes or to the first port of the built-in LAN-On-Motherboard (LOM) on Gigabyte nodes.\nInitrd (Dracut) Issues Dracut failures are often caused by the wrong interface being named nmn0, or by having multiple entries for the UAN component name (xname) in DNS. The latter is a result of multiple interfaces making DHCP requests. Either condition can cause IP address mismatches in the dvs_node_map. DNS configures entries based on DHCP leases.\nWhen dracut starts, it renames the network device named by the ifmap=netX:nmn0 kernel parameter to nmn0. This interface is the only one dracut will enable DHCP on. The ip=nmn0:dhcp kernel parameter limits dracut to DHCP only nmn0. The ifmap value must be set correctly in the kernel_parameters field of the BOS session template.\nFor UAN nodes that have more than one PCI card installed, ifmap=net2:nmn0 is the correct setting. If only one PCI card is installed, ifmap=net0:nmn0 is normally the correct setting.\nUANs require CPS and DVS to boot from images. These services are configured in dracut to retrieve the rootfs and mount it. If the image fails to download, check that DVS and CPS are both healthy, and DVS is running on all worker nodes. Run the following commands to check DVS and CPS:\nncn-m001# kubectl get nodes -l cps-pm-node=True -o custom-columns=\u0026#34;:metadata.name\u0026#34; --no-headers ncn-w001 ncn-w002 ncn-m001# for node in `kubectl get nodes -l cps-pm-node=True -o custom-columns=\u0026#34;:metadata.name\u0026#34; --no-headers`; do ssh $node \u0026#34;lsmod | grep \u0026#39;^dvs \u0026#39;\u0026#34; done ncn-w001 ncn-w002 If DVS and CPS are both healthy, then both of these commands will return all the worker NCNs in the HPE Cray EX system.\nImage Boot Issues Once dracut exits, the UAN will boot the rootfs image. Failures seen in this phase tend to be failures of spire-agent, cfs-state-reporter, or both, to start. The cfs-state-reporter tells BOA that the node is ready and allows BOA to start CFS for Node Personalization. If cfs-state-reporter does not start, check if the spire-agent has started. The cfs-state-reporter depends on the spire-agent. Running systemctl status spire-agent will show that that service is enabled and running if there are no issues with that service. Similarly, running systemctl status cfs-state-reporter will show a status of SUCCESS.\nuan# systemctl status spire-agent ● spire-agent.service - SPIRE Agent Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/spire-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Wed 2021-02-24 14:27:33 CST; 19h ago Main PID: 3581 (spire-agent) Tasks: 57 CGroup: /system.slice/spire-agent.service └─3581 /usr/bin/spire-agent run -expandEnv -config /root/spire/conf/spire-agent.conf uan# systemctl status cfs-state-reporter ● cfs-state-reporter.service - cfs-state-reporter reports configuration level of the system Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cfs-state-reporter.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2021-02-24 14:29:51 CST; 19h ago Main PID: 3827 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) "

	"content": "Upload Node Boot Information to Boot Script Service (BSS) The following information must be uploaded to BSS as a prerequisite to booting a node via iPXE:\n The location of an initrd image in the artifact repository The location of a kernel image in the artifact repository Kernel boot parameters The node(s) associated with that information, using either host name or NID  BSS manages the iPXE boot scripts that coordinate the boot process for nodes, and it enables basic association of boot scripts with nodes. The boot scripts supply a booting node with a pointer to the necessary images (kernel and initrd) and a set of boot-time parameters.\nPrerequisites  The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system. Boot Script Service (BSS) is running in containers on a non-compute node (NCN). An initrd image and kernel image for one or more nodes have been uploaded to the artifact repository (see Manage Artifacts with the Cray CLI).  Procedure Because the parameters that must be specified in the PUT command are lengthy, this procedure shows a simple bash script (not to be confused with iPXE boot scripts) to enter the boot information into BSS. The first step creates a script that can use either node ID (NID) or host name to identify the node(s) with which to associate the boot information.\n  Create a bash script to enter the following boot information into BSS in preparation for booting one or more nodes identified by NID or host name.\n  NCN = the host name of a non-compute node (NCN) that is a Kubernetes master node. This procedure uses api-gw-service-nmn.local, the API service name on the Node Management Network (NMN). For more information, see Access to System Management Services.\n  KERNEL = the download URL of the kernel image artifact that was uploaded to S3, which is in the s3://s3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/kernel format.\n  INITRD = the download URL of the initrd image artifact that was uploaded to S3, which is in the s3://s3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/initrd format.\n  PARAMS = the boot kernel parameters.\nIMPORTANT: The PARAMS line must always include the substring crashkernel=360M. This enables node dumps, which are needed to troubleshoot node crashes.\n  NIDS = a list of node IDs of the nodes to be booted.\n  HOSTS = a list of strings identifying by host name the nodes to be booted.\n  The following script is generic. A script with specific values is below this one.\n#!/bin/bash NCN=api-gw-service-nmn.local KERNEL=s3://S3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/initrd INITRD=s3://S3_BUCKET/S3_OBJECT_KEY/kernel PARAMS=\u0026quot;STRING_WITH_BOOT_PARAMETERS crashkernel=360M\u0026quot; # # By NID NIDS=NID1,NID2,NID3 cray bss bootparameters create --nids $NIDS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS # # By host name #HOSTS=\u0026quot;STRING_IDENTIFYING_HOST1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;STRING_IDENTIFYING_HOST2\u0026quot; #cray bss bootparameters create --hosts $HOSTS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS BSS supports a mechanism that allows for a default boot setup, rather than needing to specify boot details for each specific node. The HOSTS value should be set to \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; in order to utilize the default boot setup. This feature is particular useful with larger systems.\nThe following script has specific values for the kernel/initrd image names, the kernel parameters, and the list of NIDS and hosts.\n#!/bin/bash NCN=api-gw-service-nmn.local KERNEL=s3://boot-images/97b548b9-2ea9-45c9-95ba-dfc77e5522eb/kernel INITRD=s3://boot-images/97b548b9-2ea9-45c9-95ba-dfc77e5522eb/initrd PARAMS=\u0026quot;console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 initrd=97b548b9-2ea9-45c9-95ba-dfc77e5522eb root=nfs:$NCN:/var/lib/nfsroot/cmp000001_image rw nofb selinux=0 rd.net.timeout.carrier=20 crashkernel=360M\u0026quot; PARAMS=\u0026quot;console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 initrd=${INITRD##*/} \\ root=nfs:10.2.0.1:$NFS_IMAGE_ROOT_DIR rw nofb selinux=0 rd.shell crashkernel=360M \\ ip=dhcp rd.neednet=1 htburl=https://10.2.100.50/apis/hbtd/hmi/v1/heartbeat\u0026quot; # # By NID NIDS=1 cray bss bootparameters create --nids $NIDS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS # # By host name #HOSTS=\u0026quot;nid000001-nmn\u0026quot; #cray bss bootparameters create --hosts $HOSTS --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD --params $PARAMS   Run the bash script to upload the boot information to BSS for the identified nodes.\nlocalhost# chmod +x script.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./script.sh   View the boot script.\nThis will show the specific boot script that will be passed to a given node when requesting a boot script.

	"content": "View the Status of a BOS Session The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) supports a status endpoint that reports the status for individual BOS sessions. The status can be retrieved for each boot set within the session, as well as the individual items within a boot set.\nBOS sessions contain one or more boot sets. Each boot set contains one or more phases, depending upon the operation for that session. For example, a reboot operation would have a shutdown, boot, and possibly configuration phase, but a shutdown operation would only have a shutdown phase. Each phase contains the following categories not_started, in_progress, succeeded, failed, and excluded.\nMetadata Each session, boot set, and phase contains similar metadata. The following is a list of useful attributes to look for in the metadata:\n  start_time\nThe time a session, boot set, or phase started work.\n  in_progress\nThis flag means that the session, boot set, or phase has started and still has work going on.\n  complete\nThe complete flag means the session, boot set, or phase has finished.\n  error_count\nThe number of errors encountered in the boot sets or phases.\n  stop_time\nThe time a session, boot set, or phase ended work.\n  The following table summarizes how to interpret the various combinations of values for the in_progress and complete flags.\n   in_progress Flag complete Flag Meaning     False False Item has not started   True False Item is in progress   False True Item has completed   True True Invalid state (should not occur)    The in_progress flags, complete flags, and error_count flags are cumulative, meaning that they summarize the state of the sub-items.\nPhase: The in_progress flag indicates that there are nodes in the in_progress category. The complete flag means there are no nodes in the in_progress or not_started categories.\nBoot set: The in_progress flag means there is one or more phases that are in_progress. The complete flag means all phases in the boot set are complete.\nSession: The in_progress flag means one or more of the boot sets are in_progress.

	"content": "BOS Session Templates Describes the contents of a BOS session template.\nA session template can be created by specifying parameters as part of the call to the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS). When calling BOS directly, JSON is passed as part of the call.\nSession templates can be used to boot images that are customized with the Image Management Service (IMS). A session template has a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and kernel parameters used to boot them. This information is written to the Boot Script Service (BSS) and sent to each node over the specified network, enabling these nodes to boot.\nThe Simple Storage Service (S3) is used to store the manifest.json file that is created by IMS. This file contains links to all of the boot artifacts. The following S3 parameters are used in a BOS session template:\n type: This is the type of storage used. Currently, the only allowable value is s3. path: This is the path to the manifest.json file in S3. The path will follow the s3://\u0026lt;BUCKET_NAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;KEY_NAME\u0026gt; format. etag: This entity tag helps identify the version of the manifest.json file.

Boot sets sharing the same ordinal number will be addressed at the same time.\nEach boot set needs its own set of S3 parameters (path, type, and optionally etag).\nSpecify Nodes in a BOS Session Template There are three different ways to specify the nodes inside a boot set in a BOS session template. The node list, node groups, or node role groups values can be used. Each can be specified as a comma-separated list.\n  Node list\nThe \u0026quot;node_list\u0026quot; value is a list of nodes identified by component names (xnames).\nFor example:\n\u0026#34;node_list\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;x3000c0s19b1n0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x3000c0s19b1n1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;x3000c0s19b2n0\u0026#34;]   Node groups\nThe \u0026quot;node_groups\u0026quot; value is a list of groups defined by the Hardware State Manager (HSM). Each group may contain zero or more nodes. Groups can be arbitrarily defined.\nFor example:\n\u0026#34;node_groups\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;white\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pink\u0026#34;]   Node roles groups\nThe node role groups is a list of groups based on a node\u0026rsquo;s designated role. Each node\u0026rsquo;s role is specified in the HSM database. For example, to target all of the nodes with a \u0026ldquo;Compute\u0026rdquo; role, \u0026ldquo;Compute\u0026rdquo; would need to be specified in the \u0026quot;node_role_groups\u0026quot; value.\nFor example:\n\u0026#34;node_roles_groups\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Compute\u0026#34;] The following roles are defined in the HSM database:\n Compute Service System Application Storage Management    "

	"content": "BOS Sessions Overview of BOS Session operations and limitations.\nThe Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) creates a session when it is asked to perform one of these operations:\n Boot - Boot a designated collection of nodes. Shutdown - Shutdown a designated collection of nodes. Reboot - Reboot a designated collection of nodes. Configure - Configure a designated collection of booted nodes.  BOS sessions can be used to boot compute nodes with customized image roots.\nThe Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) implements each session and sees it through to completion. A BOA is a Kubernetes job. It runs once to completion. If there are transient failures, BOA will exit and Kubernetes will reschedule it so that it can re-execute its session.\nA session requires two parameters, a session template ID and an operation to perform on that template. The BOS API\u0026rsquo;s session endpoint can display a list of all of the sessions that have been created, including previous and currently running sessions. The endpoint can also display the details of a given session when the specific session ID is provided as a parameter. Sessions can also be deleted through the API.\nBOS supports a RESTful API. This API can be interacted with directly using tools like cURL. It can also be interacted with through the Cray Command Line Interface (CLI). See Manage a BOS Session for more information.\nBOA Functionality in Release 1.5 In release 1.5, BOA moves nodes towards the requested state, but if a node fails during any of the immediate steps, it takes note of it. BOA will then provide a command in the output of the BOA log that can be used to retry the action. This behavior impacts all BOS operations.\nA good example would be if there is a 6,000 node system and 3 nodes fail to power off during a BOS operation. BOA will continue and attempt to re-provision the remaining 5,997 nodes. After the command is finished, it will provide output information about what the administrator needs to do to retry the last 3 nodes that failed.\nCurrent BOS Session Limitations The following limitations currently exist with BOS sessions:\n No checking is done to prevent the launch of multiple sessions with overlapping lists of nodes. Concurrently running sessions may conflict with each other. The boot ordinal and shutdown ordinal are not honored. The partition parameter is not honored. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) has its own limitations. Refer to the CFS documentation for more information.  "

	"content": "Manage a Session Template A session template must be created before starting a session with the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS). Session templates are managed via the Cray CLI with the cray bos sessiontemplate commands.\nGet the Framework for a Session Template When creating a new BOS session template, it can be helpful to start with a framework and then edit it as needed. Use the following command to retrieve the BOS session template framework:\nncn-m001# cray bos sessiontemplatetemplate list --format json { \u0026#34;boot_sets\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name_your_boot_set\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;boot_ordinal\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;etag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your_boot_image_etag\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kernel_parameters\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-kernel-parameters\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;network\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nmn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;node_list\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;xname1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xname2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xname3\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-boot-path\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rootfs_provider\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-rootfs-provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rootfs_provider_passthrough\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-rootfs-provider-passthrough\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-boot-type\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;cfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;configuration\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;desired-cfs-config\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;enable_cfs\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name-your-template\u0026#34; } Create a Session Template with the Cray CLI The following command takes a JSON input file that contains the information required to create a new BOS session template.

	"content": "Tools for Resolving Compute Node Boot Issues A number of tools can be used to analyze and debug issues encountered during the compute node boot process. The underlying issue and symptoms dictate the type of tool required.\nnmap Use nmap to send out DHCP discover requests to test DHCP. nmap can be installed using the following command:\nncn# zypper install nmap To reach the DHCP server, the request generally needs to be sent over the Node Management network (NMN) from a non-compute node (NCN).\nIn the following example, nmap is used to send a broadcast request over the eth1 interface:\nncn# nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover -e eth1 Wireshark Use Wireshark to display network traffic. It has powerful display filters that help find information that can be used for debugging. To learn more, visit the Wireshark home page.\ntcpdump Use tcpdump to capture network traffic, such as DHCP or TFTP requests. It can be installed using the following mechanisms:\n  Install tcpdump inside an Alpine-based pod:\nalpine_pod# apk add --no-cache tcpdump   Install tcpdump on an NCN or some other node that is running SUSE:\nsuse# zypper install tcpdump   Invoking tcpdump without any arguments will write all of its output to stdout. This is reasonable for some tasks, but the volume of traffic that tcpdump can capture is large, so it is often better to write the output to a file.\nUse the following command to send tcpdump output to stdout:\nlinux# tcpdump Use the following command to send tcpdump output to a file (/tmp/tcpdump.output in the following example):\nlinux# tcpdump -w /tmp/tcpdump.output Use either tcpdump or Wireshark to read from the tcpdump file. Here is how to read the file using tcpdump:\nlinux# tcpdump -r /tmp/tcpdump.output Filtering the traffic using tcpdump filters is not recommended because when a TFTP server answers a client, it will usually use an ephemeral port that the user may not be able to identify and will not be captured by tcpdump. It is better to capture everything with tcpdump and then filter with Wireshark when looking at the resulting output. Filtering on DHCP traffic can be performed because that uses ports 67 and 68 specifically.\nTFTP client Use a TFTP client to send TFTP requests to the TFTP server. This will test that the server is functional. TFTP requests can be sent from the NCN, remote node, or laptop, as long as it targets the NMN.\nInstall the TFTP client using the following command:\nncn# zypper install atftp The atftp TFTP client can be used to request files from the TFTP server. The TFTP server is on the NMN and listens on port 69. The TFTP server sends the ipxe.efi file as the response in this example.\nRequest the files:\nncn# atftp tftp\u0026gt; connect 10.100.160.2 69 tftp\u0026gt; get ipxe.efi test-ipxe.efi tftp\u0026gt; quit List the files:\nncn# ls -l test-ipxe.efi Example output:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 951904 Sep 11 10:44 test-ipxe.efi Serial Over LAN (SOL) sessions There are two tools that can be used to access a BMC\u0026rsquo;s console via SOL:\n  ipmitool\nipmitool is a utility for controlling IPMI-enabled devices.\nUse the following command to access a node\u0026rsquo;s SOL via ipmitool:\n read -s is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.\n ncn# USERNAME=root ncn# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD ncn# export IPMI_PASSWORD ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H \u0026lt;node_management_network_IP_address_of_node\u0026gt; sol activate Example:\nncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H 10.100.165.2 sol activate   ConMan\nThe ConMan tool is used to collect logs from nodes.

	"content": "Healthy Compute Node Boot Process In order to investigate node boot-related issues, it is important to understand the flow of a healthy boot process and the associated components. This section outlines the normal flow of components that play a role in booting compute nodes, including DHCP, BSS, and TPTP.\nDHCP A healthy DHCP exchange between server and client looks like the following:\n   Traffic Description Sender     DHCP Discover A broadcast request from the client requesting an IP address. The request contains the client\u0026rsquo;s MAC address. Client   DHCP Offer The server offers an IP address to the client. Server   DHCP Request After testing the IP address to see that it is not in use, the client requests the proffered IP address. Client   DHCP ACK The server acknowledges that the client owns the lease on the IP address. Server    The following figure shows what a healthy DHCP discover process looks like via Wireshark, which is a packet analyzer:\nThe DHCP client uses port 68, whereas the DHCP server uses port 67. Unlike most Kubernetes pods, the DHCP pod is located on the host network.\nTFTP A healthy TFTP exchange between server and client looks like the following.\n   Traffic Description Sender     Read Request File: filename tsize=0 The client requests a file with a tsize equal to zero. Client   Option Acknowledgement The server acknowledges the request and provides the file\u0026rsquo;s size and block transfer size. Server   Error Code, Code: Option negotiation failed, Message: User aborted the transfer The client aborts the transfer once it determines the file size. Client   Read Request File: filename The client requests the file again. Client   Option Acknowledgement The server acknowledges the request and provides the block transfer size. Server   Acknowledgement, Block: 0 The client acknowledges the server. Client   Data Packet, Block: 1 The server sends the first data packet. Server   Acknowledgement, Block: 1 The client acknowledges reception of block 1. Client    The last two steps repeat until the file transfer is complete. The last block from the server will be labeled as (Last). The TFTP server listens on port 69. Kubernetes forwards port 69 on every node in the Kubernetes cluster to the TFTP pod.\nBoot Script Service (BSS) A healthy transaction with the Boot Script Service (BSS) looks similar to the following:\nncn-m001# cray bss bootscript list --mac a4:bf:01:3e:c0:a2 #!ipxe kernel --name kernel http://rgw.local:8080/boot-images/29c2cc23-a9d6-4e9a-ab1a-b5fa9270c975/kernel?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=5RN45WD0L8KY8W4317WP%2F20200326%2Fdefault%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20200326T185958Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=43f5b0c5909ee51dabc564d2b72401983ff8fd03cc6fc309b04cb16e67f1989d initrd=initrd console=ttyS0,115200 bad_page=panic crashkernel=360M hugepagelist=2m-2g intel_iommu=off intel_pstate=disable iommu=pt ip=dhcp numa_interleave_omit=headless numa_zonelist_order=node oops=panic pageblock_order=14 pcie_ports=native printk.synchronous=y rd.neednet=1 rd.retry=10 rd.shell k8s_gw=api-gw-service-nmn.local quiet turbo_boost_limit=999 root=craycps-s3:s3://boot-images/29c2cc23-a9d6-4e9a-ab1a-b5fa9270c975/rootfs:8c274aecef9e1668a8a44e8cfc2b24b5-165:dvs:api-gw-service-nmn.local:300:eth0 xname=x3000c0s17b4n0 nid=4 || goto boot_retry initrd --name initrd http://rgw.local:8080/boot-images/29c2cc23-a9d6-4e9a-ab1a-b5fa9270c975/initrd?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026amp;X-Amz-Credential=5RN45WD0L8KY8W4317WP%2F20200326%2Fdefault%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026amp;X-Amz-Date=20200326T185958Z\u0026amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400\u0026amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026amp;X-Amz-Signature=d18f8da89108b9f2e659d7bbefcd106d5f13703a59f8ca837bcbc5938a9f9cc5 || goto boot_retry boot || goto boot_retry :boot_retry sleep 30 chain https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?mac=a4:bf:01:3e:f9:28\u0026amp;retry=1 "

	"content": "Kernel Boot Parameters The Image Management Service (IMS) extracts kernel boot parameters from the /boot/kernel-parameters file in the image, if that file exists, and stores them in S3. IMS already stores the other boot artifacts (kernel, initrd, and rootfs) in S3. When told to boot an image, the Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) will extract these parameters and deliver them to the Boot Script Service (BSS) so they can be used during the next boot of a node.\nThere are two benefits to having kernel boot parameters extracted from the image. First, these parameters can be tightly coupled to the image. Second, these parameters do not need to be specified in the BOS session template, making the template shorter, cleaner, and less error prone.\nThe kernel boot parameters obtained from the image can be overridden by specifying the same parameters in the BOS session template. BOS supplies these parameters to the kernel in a deliberate order that causes the parameters obtained from the image to be overridden by those obtained from the session template.\nThe following is a simplified kernel boot parameter ordering:\n\u0026lt;Image parameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Session template parameters\u0026gt; If there are competing values, the ones earlier in the boot string are superseded by the ones appearing later in the string.\nThe actual contents of the boot parameters are not as simple as previously described.

The BOS session will be limited to run against components that match both the boot set information and one or more of the nodes, groups, or roles listed in the limit.\nThe table below describes the operations that can be used to further limit the scope of a BOS session.

	"content": "Boot Orchestration The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. This is accomplished using BOS components, such as boot orchestration session templates and sessions, as well as launching a Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) that fulfills boot requests.\nBOS users create a BOS session template via the REST API. A session template is a collection of metadata for a group of nodes and their desired boot artifacts and configuration. A BOS session can then be created by applying an action to a session template. The available actions are boot, reboot, shutdown, and configure. BOS will create a Kubernetes BOA job to apply an action. BOA coordinates with the underlying subsystems to complete the action requested. The session can be monitored to determine the status of the request.\nBOS depends on each of the following services to complete its tasks:\n BOA - Handles any action type submitted to the BOS API. BOA jobs are created and launched by BOS. Boot Script Service (BSS) - Stores the configuration information that is used to boot each hardware component. Nodes consult BSS for their boot artifacts and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot. Configuration Framework Service (CFS) - BOA launches CFS to apply configuration to the nodes in its boot sets (node personalization). Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) - Used to power on and off the nodes. Hardware State Manager (HSM) - Tracks the state of each node and what groups and roles nodes are included in.  Use the BOS Cray CLI Commands BOS utilizes the Cray CLI commands.

The following changes will be made:\n The --template-body option for the Cray CLI bos command will be deprecated. Performing a GET on the session status for a boot set (i.e. /v1/session/{session_id}/status/{boot_set_name}) currently returns a status code of 201, but instead it should return a status code of 200. This will be corrected to return 200.  "

	"content": "Clean Up After a BOS/BOA Job is Completed or Cancelled When a BOS session is created, there are a number of items created on the system. When a session is cancelled or completed, these items need to be cleaned up to ensure there is not lingering content from the session on the system.\nWhen a session is launched, the items below are created:\n Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) job: The Kubernetes job that runs and handles the BOS session. ConfigMap for BOA: This ConfigMap contains the configuration information that the BOA job uses. The BOA pod mounts a ConfigMap named boot-session at /mnt/boot_session inside the pod. This ConfigMap has a random UUID name, such as e786def5-37a6-40db-b36b-6b67ebe174ee. This name does not obviously connect it to the BOA job. etcd entries: BOS makes an entry for the session in its etcd key/value store. If the BOA job has run for long enough, it will also have written a status entry into etcd for this session. Configuration Framework Service (CFS) session: If configuration is enabled, and the session is doing a boot, reboot, or configure operation, then BOA will have instructed CFS to configure the nodes once they boot. There is not an easy way to link a BOA session to the CFS sessions that are spawned.  Prerequisites  A Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session has been completed or cancelled. The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system.  Procedure   Identify the BOA job that needs to be deleted.\nDescribe the BOS session to find the name of the BOA job under the attribute boa_job_name.\nncn-m001# cray bos session describe --format json BOS_SESSION_ID { \u0026#34;status_link\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/v1/session/d200f7e4-1a9f-4466-9ef4-30add3bd87dd/status\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;complete\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;start_time\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-08-11 21:02:09.137917\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateUuid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cle-1.3.0-nid1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;error_count\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;boa_job_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;boa-d200f7e4-1a9f-4466-9ef4-30add3bd87dd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;in_progress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;operation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;boot\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;stop_time\u0026#34;: null }   Find the ConfigMap for the BOA job.\nThe ConfigMap is listed as boot-session under the Volumes section. Retrieve the Name value from the returned output.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services describe job BOA_JOB_NAME ... Volumes: boot-session: Type: ConfigMap (a volume populated by a ConfigMap) **Name: e786def5-37a6-40db-b36b-6b67ebe174ee** Optional: false   Delete the ConfigMap.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services delete cm CONFIGMAP_NAME   Delete the etcd entry for the BOS session.\nncn-m001# cray bos session delete BOS_SESSION_ID   Stop CFS from configuring nodes.\nThere are several different use cases covered in this step. The process varies depending on whether a job is being cancelled, or if the CFS content is simply being cleaned up.\nIn the BOS session template, if configuration is enabled, BOA instructs the nodes to configure on boot when doing a boot or reboot operation. When only doing a configure operation, the configuration happens right away. If configuration is disabled or the operation is shutdown, then BOA will not instruct CFS to configure the nodes, and nothing further needs to be done. The remainder of this step may be skipped.\nIf BOA instructs CFS to configure the nodes, then CFS will set the desired configuration for the nodes in its database. Once BOA tells CFS to configure the nodes, which happens early in the BOA job, then CFS will configure the nodes immediately if the operation is configure, or upon the node booting if the operation is boot or reboot.\nAttempting to prevent CFS from configuring the nodes is a multi-step, tedious process. It may be simpler to allow CFS to configure the nodes. If the nodes are going to be immediately rebooted, then the CFS configuration will be rerun once the nodes have booted, thus undoing any previous configuration. Alternately, if the nodes are going to be immediately shutdown, this will remove any need to prevent CFS from configuring the nodes.\nFollow the procedures for one of the following use cases:\n  Configuration has completed and the sessions need to be cleaned up the to reduce clutter:\n  Find the old sessions that needs to be deleted.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions list   Delete the sessions.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions delete CFS_SESSION_NAME     Configuration has completed and the desired state needs to be cleaned up so that configuration does not happen on restart:\n  Unset the desired state for all components affected.\nTo find the impacted component names (xnames) for the components with the desired configuration matching what was applied:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components list Prevent the configuration from running:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components update XNAME --desired-state-commit This needs to be done for each component. It is enough to prevent configuration from running, and it does not revert to the previous desired state. The previous desired state has already been overwritten at this point, so if the user is trying to completely revert, they will either need to know and apply the previous desired state manually, or return BOS with the previous template using the configure operation (which may also trigger a configure operation).\n    Configuration was set/started and needs to be cancelled:\n  Unset the desired state for all components affected.\nTo find the impacted component names (xnames) for the components with the desired configuration matching what was applied:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components list Prevent the configuration from running:\nncn-m001# cray cfs components update XNAME --desired-state-commit This needs to be done for each component. It is enough to prevent configuration from running, and it does not revert to the previous desired state. The previous desired state has already been overwritten at this point, so if the user is trying to completely revert, they will either need to know and apply the previous desired state manually, or return BOS with the previous template using the configure operation (which may also trigger a configure operation).\n  Restart the batcher.\nThis will purge any information that CFS cached in relation to the BOA job that it was intending to act upon.\nTo get the cfs-batcher pod id:\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services get pods|grep cray-cfs-batcher cray-cfs-batcher-644599c6cc-rwl8f 2/2 Running 0 6d17h To restart the pod, scale the replicas to 0 to stop it, and back up to 1 to restart it:\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services scale CFS-BATCHER_POD_ID --replicas=0 ncn-m001# kubectl -n services scale CFS-BATCHER_POD_ID --replicas=1   Find the existing session that needs to be deleted.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions list   Delete the sessions.\nThis step must be done after restarting cfs-batcher. If the cached information is not purged from Batcher first, then Batcher may start additional CFS sessions in response to them being killed. The Batcher agent would fight against the user if it is not restarted.\nUnfortunately, it is hard to link a specific BOA session to a CFS session. At this time, they are identified by comparing the CFS timestamps with those of the BOA job, and associating them based on proximity. Additionally, examine the components in the CFS job to see that they match the components in the BOA job.\nncn-m001# cray cfs sessions delete CFS_SESSION_NAME       Delete the BOA job.\nThe BOA job is not deleted right away because it is needed to find the ConfigMap name.\nncn-m001# kubectl -n services delete job BOA_JOB_NAME   "

	"content": "Compute Node Boot Issue Symptom: Duplicate Address Warnings and Declined DHCP Offers in Logs If the DHCP and node logs show duplicate address warnings and indicate declined DHCP offers, it may be because another component owns the IP address that DHCP is trying to assign to a node. If this happens, the node will not accept the IP address and will repeatedly submit a DHCP discover request. As a result, the node and DHCP become entangled in a loop of requesting and rejecting. This often happens when DHCP is statically assigning IP addresses to nodes, but the assigned IP address for a node has already been assigned to another component.\nSymptoms This scenario results in node logs similar to the following:\nNode log:\n[ 97.946332] dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. retrying [ 97.789015] dracut-initqueue[604]: dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. \\ retrying [ 108.007243] dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. retrying [ 107.873650] dracut-initqueue[604]: dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. \\ retrying [ 110.082877] dracut Warning: Duplicate address detected for 10.100.160.195 while doing dhcp. retrying DHCP log:\nAbandoning IP address 10.100.160.195: declined. DHCPDECLINE of 10.100.160.195 from a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c (undefined) via eth0: abandoned DHCPOFFER on 10.100.160.195 to \u0026#34;\u0026#34; (undefined) via eth0 DHCPREQUEST for 10.100.160.195 (10.100.160.2) from a4:bf:01:29:92:be via eth0: unknown lease 10.100.160.195. DHCPREQUEST for 10.100.160.195 (10.100.160.2) from a4:bf:01:29:92:eb via eth0: unknown lease 10.100.160.195. DHCPOFFER on 10.100.160.195 to a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c via eth0 DHCPREQUEST for 10.100.160.195 (10.100.160.2) from a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c via eth0 DHCPACK on 10.100.160.195 to a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c via eth0 Abandoning IP address 10.100.160.195: declined. Notice that two different components (identifiable by the two different MAC addresses a4:bf:01:29:92:eb and a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c) have made DHCP requests for the IP address 10.100.160.195.\na4:bf:01:29:92:eb is the component that owns the IP address 10.100.160.195, while a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c has been statically assigned the IP address 10.100.160.195 in the DHCP configuration file. As such, DHCP keeps trying to assign it that address, but after being offered the address, a4:bf:01:2e:81:4c declines it because it realizes that a4:bf:01:29:92:eb already owns it.\nProblem Detection There are multiple ways to check if this problem exists:\n  Ping the IP address and see if another component responds. Log into the component and determine its IP address. If it is the same as the IP address that DHCP is attempting to assign, then this issue does exist.\n  Check the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache using the arp command. Because it is a cache, it is possible that IP addresses can age out of the cache, so the IP address may not be present. If the address that is failing to be assigned is in the ARP cache, and it is assigned to a node with a different MAC address, then that is confirmation that this problem has occurred.\nncn-m001# arp

	"content": "BOS Workflows The following workflows present a high-level overview of common Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) operations. These workflows depict how services interact with each other when booting, configuring, or shutting down nodes. They also help provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.\nThe following workflows are included in this section:\n Boot and Configure Nodes Reconfigure Nodes Power Off Nodes  Boot and Configure Nodes Use Case: Administrator powers on and configures select compute nodes.\nComponents: This workflow is based on the interaction of the BOS with other services during the boot process:\nMentioned in this workflow:\n Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. The Boot Orchestration Service has the following components:  Boot Orchestration Session Template is a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and parameters. Boot Orchestration Session carries out an operation. The possible operations in a session are boot, shutdown, reboot, and configure. Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) is automatically launched to execute the session. A BOA executes the given operation, and if the operation is a boot or a reboot, it also configures the nodes post-boot (if configure is enabled).   Cray Advanced Platform and Monitoring Control (CAPMC) service provides system-level power control for nodes in the system. CAPMC interfaces directly with the Redfish APIs to the controller infrastructure to effect power and environmental changes on the system. Hardware State Manager (HSM) tracks the state of each node and their group and role associations. Boot Script Service (BSS) stores per-node information about iPXE boot script. Nodes consult BSS for boot artifacts (kernel, initrd, image root) and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot. The Simple Storage Service (Ceph S3) is an artifact repository that stores boot artifacts. Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configures nodes using configuration framework. Launches and aggregates the status from one or more Ansible instances against nodes (node personalization) or images (image customization).  Workflow Overview: The following sequence of steps occur during this workflow.\n  Administrator creates a configuration\nAdd a configuration to CFS.\n# cray cfs configurations update sample-config --file configuration.json { \u0026quot;lastUpdated\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2020-09-22T19:56:32Z\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;layers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;cloneUrl\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/configmanagement. git\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;commit\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;01b8083dd89c394675f3a6955914f344b90581e2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;playbook\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;site.yaml\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;sample-config\u0026quot; }   Administrator creates a session template\nA session template is a collection of metadata for a group of nodes and their desired configuration. A session template can be created from a JSON structure. It returns a SessionTemplate ID if successful.\nSee Manage a Session Template for more information.\n  Administrator creates a session\nCreate a session to perform the operation specified in the operation request parameter on the boot set defined in the session template.

The Boot Orchestration Service has the following components:  Boot Orchestration Session Template is a collection of one or more boot set objects. A boot set defines a collection of nodes and the information about the boot artifacts and parameters. Boot Orchestration Session carries out an operation. The possible operations in a session are boot, shutdown, reboot, and configure. Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) is automatically launched to execute the session. A BOA executes the given operation, and if the operation is a boot or a reboot, it also configures the nodes post-boot (if configure is enabled).   Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configures nodes using configuration framework. Launches and aggregates the status from one or more Ansible instances against nodes (node personalization) or images (image customization).

	"content": "Manage Artifacts with the Cray CLI The artifacts (objects) available for use on the system are created and managed with the Cray CLI. The cray artifacts command provides the ability to manage any given artifact. The Cray CLI automatically authenticates users and provides Simple Storage Service (S3) credentials.\nAll operations with the cray artifacts command assume that the user has already been authenticated. If the user has not been authenticated with the Cray CLI, run the following command and enter the appropriate credentials:\nncn# cray auth login Username: adminuser Password: Success! Authorization Is Local to a Host: whenever you are using the CLI (cray command) on a host (e.g. a workstation or NCN) where it has not been used before, it is necessary to authenticate on that host using cray auth login.

This is useful for organizing objects within a bucket, but S3 treats it as a name only. No directory structure exists.\nWhen interacting with Cray services, use the artifact value returned by the cray artifacts create command. This will ensure that Cray services can access the uploaded object.\nDownload Artifacts Artifacts are downloaded with the cray artifacts get command.

To solve this problem, UAS installs Kubernetes network attachments within the Kubernetes user namespace, one of which is used by UAIs.\nThe type of network attachment used on HPE Cray EX hardware for this purpose is a macvlan network attachment, so this is often referred to on HPE Cray EX systems as \u0026ldquo;macvlans\u0026rdquo;. This network attachment integrates the UAI into the NMN on the UAI host node where the UAI is running and assigns the UAI an IP address on that network.

It is unlikely that a site will choose to create end-user UAIs this way, but it is possible to do. The administrative UAI management API provides an administrative way to list, create, examine and delete UAIs.\nThe legacy mode of UAI management gives users the authority to create, list and delete UAIs that belong to them. While this is a conceptually simple mode, it can lead to an unnecessary proliferation of UAIs belonging to a single user if the user is not careful to create UAIs only when needed. The legacy mode also cannot take advantage of UAI classes to create more than one kind of UAI for different users' needs.\nThe UAI broker mode creates / re-uses UAIs on demand when a user logs into a broker UAI using SSH. A site may run multiple broker UAIs, each configured to create UAIs of a different UAI class and each running with its own externally visible IP address. By choosing the correct IP address and logging into the broker, a user ultimately arrives in a UAI tailored for a given use case. Because the broker is responsible for managing the underlying end-user UAIs, users need not be given authority to create UAIs directly and, therefore, cannot cause a proliferation of unneeded UAIs. Because the broker UAIs each run separately on different IP addresses with, potentially, different user authorizations configured, a site can control which users are given access to which classes of end-user UAIs.\n"

	"content": "UAI Network Attachments The UAI network attachment configuration flows from the CRAY Site Initializer (CSI) localization data through customizations.yaml into the UAS Helm chart and, ultimately, into Kubernetes in the form of a \u0026ldquo;network-attachment-definition\u0026rdquo;.\nThis section describes the data at each of those stages to show how the final network attachment gets created.\nCSI Localization Data The details of CSI localization are beyond the scope of this guide, but here are the important settings, and the values used in the following examples:\n The interface name on which the Kubernetes worker nodes reach their NMN subnet: vlan002 The network and CIDR configured on that interface: 10.252.0.0/17 The IP address of the gateway to other NMN subnets found on that network: 10.252.0.1 The subnets where compute nodes reside on this system:  10.92.100.0/24 10.106.0.0/17 10.104.0.0/17    Contents of customizations.yaml When CSI runs, it produces the following data structure in the spec section of customizations.yaml:\nspec: ... wlm: ... macvlansetup: nmn_subnet: 10.252.2.0/23 nmn_supernet: 10.252.0.0/17 nmn_supernet_gateway: 10.252.0.1 nmn_vlan: vlan002 # NOTE: the term DHCP here is misleading, this is merely # a range of reserved IP addresses for UAIs that should not # be handed out to others because the network # attachment will hand them out to UAIs. nmn_dhcp_start: 10.252.2.10 nmn_dhcp_end: 10.252.3.254 routes: - dst: 10.92.100.0/24 gw: 10.252.0.1 - dst: 10.106.0.0/17 gw: 10.252.0.1 - dst: 10.104.0.0/17 gw: 10.252.0.1 The nmn_subnet value shown here is not relevant for this section.\nThese values, in turn, feed into the following translation to UAS Helm chart settings:\n cray-uas-mgr: uasConfig: uai_macvlan_interface: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_vlan }}' uai_macvlan_network: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_supernet }}' uai_macvlan_range_start: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_dhcp_start }}' uai_macvlan_range_end: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.nmn_dhcp_end }}' uai_macvlan_routes: '{{ wlm.macvlansetup.routes }}' UAS Helm Chart The inputs in the previous section tell the UAS Helm chart how to install the network attachment for UAIs. While the actual template used for this is more complex, the following is a simplified view of the template used to generate the network attachment.\nIf reading this document from the UAS source code, the real template in the Helm chart is located there.\napiVersion: \u0026quot;k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1\u0026quot; kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition ... spec: config: '{ \u0026quot;cniVersion\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.3.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;macvlan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;master\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_interface }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bridge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ipam\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;host-local\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subnet\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_network }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeStart\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_range_start }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeEnd\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_range_end }}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;routes\u0026quot;: [ {{- range $index, $route := .Values.uasConfig.uai_macvlan_routes }} {{- range $key, $value := $route }} { \u0026quot;{{ $key }}\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{ $value }}\u0026quot;, }, {{- end }} {{- end }} ] } }' The range templating in the routes section expands the routes from customizations.yaml into the network attachment routes.\nUAI Network Attachment in Kubernetes All of this produces a network attachment definition in Kubernetes called macvlan-uas-nmn-conf which is used by UAS.\nThe following contents would result from the above data:\napiVersion: v1 items: - apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1 kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition ... spec: config: '{ \u0026quot;cniVersion\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.3.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;macvlan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;master\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;vlan002\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bridge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ipam\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;host-local\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subnet\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.0/17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeStart\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.124.10\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rangeEnd\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.125.244\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;routes\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;dst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.92.100.0/24\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gw\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.1\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;dst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.106.0.0/17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gw\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.1\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;dst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.104.0.0/17\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gw\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.252.0.1\u0026quot; } ] } }' ... In this example, Kubernetes will assign UAI IP addresses in the range 10.252.2.10 through 10.252.3.244 on the network attachment, and will permit those UAIs to reach compute nodes on any of four possible NMN subnets:\n Directly through the NMN subnet hosting the UAI host node itself (10.252.0.0/17 here) Through the gateway in the local NMN subnet (10.252.0.1 here) to  10.92.100.0/24 10.106.0.0/17 10.104.0.0/17    "

	"content": "UAS and UAI Health Checks Initialize and authorize the CLI so a user may run procedures on any given node.\nInitialize and Authorize the CLI The procedures below use the CLI as an authorized user and run on two separate node types. The first part runs on the LiveCD node while the second part runs on a non-LiveCD Kubernetes master or worker node. When using the CLI on either node, the CLI configuration must be initialized and the user running the procedure must be authorized. This section describes how to initialize the CLI for use by a user and authorize the CLI as a user to run the procedures on any given node. The procedures will need to be repeated in both stages of the validation procedure.\nDiscontinue Use of the CRAY_CREDENTIALS Service Account Token Installation procedures leading up to production mode on Shasta use the CLI with a Kubernetes managed service account normally used for internal operations. There is a procedure for extracting the OAUTH token for this service account and assigning it to the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable to permit simple CLI operations. The UAS / UAI validation procedure runs as a post-installation procedure and requires an actual user with Linux credentials, not this service account. Prior to running any of the steps below you must unset the CRAY_CREDENTIALS environment variable.\nncn-m002# unset CRAY_CREDENTIALS Initialize the CLI Configuration The CLI needs to know what host to use to obtain authorization and what user is requesting authorization so it can obtain an OAUTH token to talk to the API Gateway. This is accomplished by initializing the CLI configuration. This example uses the vers username. In practice, vers and the response to the password: prompt should be replaced with the username and password of the administrator running the validation procedure.\nTo check whether the CLI needs initialization, run the following command.\nncn-m002# cray config describe If the output appears as follows, the CLI requires initialization.\nUsage: cray config describe [OPTIONS] Error: No configuration exists. Run `cray init` If the output appears more like the following, then the CLI is initialized and logged in as vers. If that is the incorrect username, authorize the correct username and password in the next section. If vers is the correct user, proceed to the validation procedure on that node.\nIf the CLI must be initialized again, use the following command and include the correct username, password, and the password response.\nncn-m002# cray init Cray Hostname: api-gw-service-nmn.local Username: vers Password: Success! Initialization complete. Authorize the Correct CLI User If the CLI is initialized but authorized for a user different, run the following command and substitute the correct username and password.\nncn-m002# cray auth login Username: vers Password: Success! Authorization Is Local to a Host: whenever you are using the CLI (cray command) on a host (e.g. a workstation or NCN) where it has not been used before, it is necessary to authenticate on that host using cray auth login. There is no mechanism to distribute CLI authorization amongst hosts.\nTroubleshoot CLI Initialization or Authorization Issues If initialization or authorization fails in any of the preceding steps, there are several common causes.\n DNS failure looking up api-gw-service-nmn.local may be preventing the CLI from reaching the API Gateway and Keycloak for authorization Network connectivity issues with the NMN may be preventing the CLI from reaching the API Gateway and Keycloak for authorization Certificate mismatch or trust issues may be preventing a secure connection to the API Gateway Istio failures may be preventing traffic from reaching Keycloak Keycloak may not yet be set up to authorize you as a user  While resolving these issues is beyond the scope of this section, adding -vvvvv to the cray auth or cray init commands may offer clues as to why the initialization or authorization is failing.\nValidate the Basic UAS Installation This procedure and the following procedures run on separate nodes on the system and validate the basic UAS installation. Ensure this runs on the LiveCD node and that the CLI is authorized for the user.\nncn-m002# cray uas mgr-info list service_name = \u0026#34;cray-uas-mgr\u0026#34; version = \u0026#34;1.11.5\u0026#34; ncn-m001-pit# cray uas list results = [] This shows that UAS is installed and running version 1.11.5 and that no UAIs are running. If another user has been using the UAS, it is possible to see UAIs in the list. That is acceptable from a validation standpoint.\nTo verify that the pre-made UAI images are registered with UAS, run the following command.\nncn-m002# cray uas images list default_image = \u0026#34;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026#34; image_list = [ \u0026#34;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026#34;,] The output shows that the pre-made end-user UAI image, cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest, is registered with UAS. This does not necessarily mean this image is installed in the container image registry, but it is configured for use. If other UAI images have been created and registered, they may also appear in the output.\nValidate UAI Creation This procedure:\n Must run on a master or worker node (and not ncn-w001). Must run on the HPE Cray EX system (or from an external host, but the procedure for that is not covered here). Requires that the CLI be initialized and authorized as for the current user.  To verify that the user account can create a UAI, use the following command.\nncn-w003# cray uas create --publickey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub uai_connect_string = \u0026#34;ssh vers@10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_host = \u0026#34;ncn-w001\u0026#34; uai_img = \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026#34; uai_ip = \u0026#34;10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_msg = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; uai_name = \u0026#34;uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026#34; uai_status = \u0026#34;Pending\u0026#34; username = \u0026#34;vers\u0026#34; [uai_portmap] The UAI is now created and in the process of initializing and running.\nThe following can be repeated as needed to view the UAIs state. If the results appear like the following, the UAI is ready for use.\nncn-w003# cray uas list [[results]] uai_age = \u0026#34;0m\u0026#34; uai_connect_string = \u0026#34;ssh vers@10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_host = \u0026#34;ncn-w001\u0026#34; uai_img = \u0026#34;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026#34; uai_ip = \u0026#34;10.16.234.10\u0026#34; uai_msg = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; uai_name = \u0026#34;uai-vers-a00fb46b\u0026#34; uai_status = \u0026#34;Running: Ready\u0026#34; username = \u0026#34;vers\u0026#34; Log into the UAI (without a password) as follows:\nncn-w003# ssh vers@10.16.234.10 The authenticity of host \u0026#39;10.16.234.10 (10.16.234.10)\u0026#39; can\u0026#39;t be established.

A good place to start is in the Events section at the bottom. Notice the warnings here about volumes whose secrets and configmaps are not found. In this case, that means the UAI cannot start because it was started in legacy mode without a default UAI class, and some of the volumes configured in the UAS are in the uas namespace to support localization of broker UAIs and cannot be found in the user namespace. To solve this particular problem, the best move would be to configure a default UAI class with the correct volume list in it, delete the UAI, and allow the user to try creating it again using the default class.\nOther problems can usually be quickly identified using this and other information found in the output from the kubectl describe pod command.\n  "

	"content": "Troubleshoot UAIs with Administrative Access Sometimes there is no better way to figure out a problem with a UAI than to get inside it and look around as an administrator. This is done using kubectl exec to start a shell inside the running container as root (in the container). With this an administrator can diagnose problems, make changes to the running UAI, and find solutions. It is important to remember that any change made inside a UAI is transitory. These changes only last as long as the UAI is running. To make a permanent change, either the UAI image has to be changed or external customizations must be applied.\nSummary The high-level steps of the procedure are the following:\n Find the name of the UAI in question. Use that name with kubectl to find the pod containing that UAI. Use that pod name, the UAI name (as the container name), and the user namespace to open an interactive shell in the container with kubectl exec. From this shell, look around the UAI as needed.

Check that nodes are labeled with uas=True and are in the Ready state.\nncn-w001# kubectl get nodes -l uas NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-w001 Ready master 11d v1.13.3 If none of the nodes are found or if the nodes listed are marked as NotReady, the UAI pods will not be scheduled and will not start.\nTroubleshoot kubectl Certificate Issues While kubectl is supported in a UAI, kubeconfig file to access a Kubernetes cluster is not provided. To use kubectl to interface with a Kubernetes cluster, the user must supply their own kubeconfig.\n[user@uai-user-be3a6770-6876c88676-2p2lk ~]# kubectl get nodes The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port? For instructions to copy certificates into a UAI, see Move Application Data from an External Workstation to a UAI.\nSpecify the location of the Kubernetes certificate with KUBECONFIG.\n[user@uai-user-be3a6770-6876c88676-2p2lk ~]# KUBECONFIG=/tmp/CONFIG kubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-m001 Ready master 16d v1.13.3 ncn-m002 Ready master 16d v1.13.3 Users must specify KUBECONFIG with every kubectl command or specify the kubeconfig file location for the life of the UAI. To do this, either set the KUBECONFIG environment variable or set the --kubeconfig flag .\nTroubleshoot X11 Issues The system may return the following error if the user attempts to use an application that requires an X window (such as xeyes):\n$ ssh user@203.0.113.0 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ______ ____ ___ __ __ __ __ ___ ____ / ____// __ \\ / |\\ \\/ / / / / // | / _/ / / / /_/ // /| | \\  / / / / // /| | / / / /___ / _, _// ___ | / / / /_/ // ___ | _/ / \\____//_/ |_|/_/ |_|/_/ \\____//_/ |_|/___/ [user@uai-user-be3a6770-6876c88676-2p2lk ~]$ xeyes Error: Can\u0026#39;t open display: To resolve this issue, pass the -X option with the ssh command as show below:\n$ ssh UAI_USERNAME@UAI_IP_ADDRESS -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -X ______ ____ ___ __ __ __ __ ___ ____ / ____// __ \\ / |\\ \\/ / / / / // | / _/ / / / /_/ // /| | \\  / / / / // /| | / / / /___ / _, _// ___ | / / / /_/ // ___ | _/ / \\____//_/ |_|/_/ |_|/_/ \\____//_/ |_|/___/ /usr/bin/xauth: file /home/users/user/.Xauthority does not exist [user@uai-user-be3a6770-6876c88676-2p2lk ~]$ echo $DISPLAY 203.0.113.0 The warning stating \u0026ldquo;Xauthority does not exist\u0026rdquo; will disappear with subsequent logins.\nTroubleshoot SSH Host Key Issues If strict host key checking enabled is enabled on the user\u0026rsquo;s client, the below error may appear when connecting to a UAI over ssh.\nWARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED This can occur in a few circumstances, but is most likely to occur after the UAI container is restarted. If this occurs, remove the offending ssh hostkey from the local known_hosts file and try to connect again. The error message from ssh will contain the correct path to the known_hosts file and the line number of the problematic key.\nDelete UAS Objects with kubectl If Kubernetes resources used to create a UAI are not cleaned up during the normal deletion process, resources can be deleted with the following commands.\nDelete anything created by the User Access Service (uas-mgr):\nWARNING: This command will delete all UAS resources for the entire system, it is not for targeted cleanup of a single UAI.\nncn-w001# kubectl delete all -n user -l uas=managed Delete all objects associated with a particular UAI:\nncn-w001# kubectl delete all -n user -l app=UAI-NAME Delete all objects for a single user:\nncn-w001# kubectl delete all -n user -l user=USERNAME Hard limits on UAI Creation Each Kubernetes worker node has limits on how many pods it can run. Nodes are installed by default with a hard limit of 110 pods per node, but the number of pods may be further limited by memory and CPU utilization constraints. For a standard node the maximum number of UAIs per node is 110; if other pods are co-scheduled on the node, the number will be reduced.\nDetermine the hard limit on Kubernetes pods with kubectl describe node and look for the Capacity section.\n# kubectl describe node NODE_NAME -o yaml ... capacity: cpu: \u0026quot;16\u0026quot; ephemeral-storage: 1921298528Ki hugepages-1Gi: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; hugepages-2Mi: \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; memory: 181009640Ki pods: \u0026quot;110\u0026quot; ... When UAIs are created, some UAIs might left in the \u0026ldquo;Pending\u0026rdquo; state. The Kubernetes scheduler is unable to schedule them to a node, because of CPU, memory, or pod limit constraints. Use kubectl describe pod to check why the pod is pending. For example, this pod is \u0026ldquo;Pending\u0026rdquo; because the node has reached the hard limit of 110 pods.\n# kubectl describe pod UAI-POD Warning Failed Scheduling 21s (x20 over 4m31s) default-scheduler 0/4 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient pods, 3 node(s) didn't match node selector.

This identifier is also used to create UAIs using this class with the cray uas admin uais create   comment A free-form string describing the UAI class     default A boolean value (flag) indicating whether this class is the default class. When this field is set to true, this class overrides both the default UAI image and any specified image name when the cray uas create command is used to create an end-user UAI for a user. Setting a class to \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: true, gives the administrator fine-grained control over the behavior of end-user UAIs that are created by authorized users in legacy mode.   namespace The Kubernetes namespace in which this UAI will run. The default setting is user.   opt_ports An optional list of TCP port numbers that will be opened on the external IP address of the UAI when it runs. This field controls whether services other than SSH can be run and reached publicly on the UAI. If this list is empty (like the preceding example), only SSH will be externally accessible.   priority_class_name The Kubernetes priority class of the UAI. \u0026ldquo;uai_priority\u0026rdquo; is the default. Using other values affects both Kubernetes default resource limit and request assignments and the Kubernetes scheduling priority for the UAI.   public_ip A boolean value that indicates whether the UAI will be given an external IP address from the LoadBalancer service. Such an address enables clients outside the Kubernetes cluster to reach the UAI. This field controls whether the UAI is reachable by SSH from external clients, but it also controls whether the ports in opt_ports are reachable. If this field is set to false, the UAI will have only an internal IP address, reachable from within the Kubernetes cluster.   resource_config Can be set to a resource specification to override namespace defaults on Kubernetes resource requests and limits. This field is not set in the preceding example.   uai_compute_network A flag that indicates whether this UAI uses the macvlan mechanism to gain access to the HPE Cray EX compute node network.

This UAI also gains access to the Lustre file system mounted on the host node. On the host node, the file system is mounted at /lus and the UAI mounts the file system at the same mount point as the host node. Lastly, the UAI class includes two Slurm configuration items, the munge key and the Slurm configuration file. These are obtained from Kubernetes and the UAI mounts them as files at /root/slurm_config/munge and /etc/slurm respectively.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "UAI Host Node Selection When selecting UAI host nodes, it is a good idea to take into account the amount of combined load users and system services will bring to those nodes. UAIs run by default at a lower priority than system services on worker nodes which means that, if the combined load exceeds the capacity of the nodes, Kubernetes will eject UAIs and/or refuse to schedule them to protect system services. This can be disruptive or frustrating for users. This section explains how to identify the currently configured UAI host nodes and how to adjust that selection to meet the needs of users.\nIdentify UAI Host Nodes UAI host node identification is an exclusive activity, not an inclusive one, so it starts by identifying the nodes that could potentially be UAI host nodes by their Kubernetes role:\n Identify nodes that could potentially be UAI host nodes by their Kubernetes role.  ncn-m001-pit# kubectl get nodes | grep -v master NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-w001 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.18.6 ncn-w002 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 25d v1.18.6 ncn-w003 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 23d v1.18.6 In this example, there are three nodes known by Kubernetes that are not running as Kubernetes master nodes. These are all potential UAI host nodes.\n Identify the nodes that are excluded from eligibility as UAI host nodes.  ncn-m001-pit# kubectl get no -l uas=False NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ncn-w001 Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 10d v1.18.6 NOTE: Given the fact that labels are textual not boolean, it is a good idea to try various common spellings of false. The ones that will prevent UAIs from running are \u0026lsquo;False\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;FALSE\u0026rsquo;. Repeat the above with all three options to be sure.\nOf the non-master nodes, there is one node that is configured to reject UAIs, ncn-w001. So, ncn-w002 and ncn-w003 are UAI host nodes.\nSpecify UAI Host Nodes UAI host nodes are determined by tainting the nodes against UAIs. For example:\nncn-m001-pit# kubectl label node ncn-w001 uas=False --overwrite Please note here that setting uas=True or any variant of that, while potentially useful for local book keeping purposes, does NOT transform the node into a UAS host node. With that setting the node will be a UAS node because the value of the uas flag is not in the list False, false or FALSE, but unless the node previously had one of the false values, it was a UAI node all along. Perhaps more to the point, removing the uas label from a node labeled uas=True does not take the node out of the list of UAI host nodes. The only way to make a non-master Kubernetes node not be a UAS host node is to explicitly set the label to False, false or FALSE.\nMaintain an HSM Group for UAI Host Nodes When it comes to customizing non-compute node (NCN) contents for UAIs, it is useful to have a Hardware State Manager (HSM) node group containing the NCNs that are UAI hosts nodes. The hpe-csm-scripts package provides a script called make_node_groups that is useful for this purpose. This script is normally installed as /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups. It can create and update node groups for management master nodes, storage nodes, management worker nodes, and UAI host nodes.\nThe following summarizes its use:\nncn-m001# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups --help getopt: unrecognized option '--help' usage: make_node_groups [-m][-s][-u][w][-A][-R][-N] Where: -m - creates a node group for management master nodes -s - creates a node group for management storage nodes -u - creates a node group for UAI worker nodes -w - creates a node group for management worker nodes -A - creates all of the above node groups -N - executes a dry run, showing commands not running them -R - deletes existing node group(s) before creating them Here is an example of a dry-run that will create or update a node group for UAI host nodes:\nncn-m001# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups -N -R -u (dry run)cray hsm groups delete uai (dry run)cray hsm groups create --label uai (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s4b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s5b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s6b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s7b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s8b0n0 (dry run)cray hsm groups members create uai --id x3000c0s9b0n0 Notice that when run in dry-run (-N option) mode, the script only prints out the CLI commands it will execute without actually executing them. When run with the -R option, the script removes any existing node groups before recreating them, effectively updating the contents of the node group. The -u option tells the script to create or update only the node group for UAI host nodes. That node group is named uai in the HSM.\nSo, to create a new node group or replace an existing one, called uai, containing the list of UAI host nodes, use the following command:\n# /opt/cray/csm/scripts/node_management/make_node_groups -R -u "

The easy way to do this is to use the command specifying the uai-creation-class identifier from the broker\u0026rsquo;s UAI class.\ncray uas admin uais delete --class-id \u0026lt;creation-class-id\u0026gt; For example:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin config classes list | grep -e class_id -e comment class_id = \u0026quot;74970cdc-9f94-4d51-8f20-96326212b468\u0026quot; comment = \u0026quot;UAI broker class\u0026quot; class_id = \u0026quot;a623a04a-8ff0-425e-94cc-4409bdd49d9c\u0026quot; comment = \u0026quot;UAI User Class\u0026quot; class_id = \u0026quot;bb28a35a-6cbc-4c30-84b0-6050314af76b\u0026quot; comment = \u0026quot;Non-Brokered UAI User Class\u0026quot; ncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin config classes describe 74970cdc-9f94-4d51-8f20-96326212b468 | grep uai_creation_class uai_creation_class = \u0026quot;a623a04a-8ff0-425e-94cc-4409bdd49d9c\u0026quot; ncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais delete --class-id a623a04a-8ff0-425e-94cc-4409bdd49d9c results = [ \u0026quot;Successfully deleted uai-vers-6da50e7a\u0026quot;,] After that, users should be able to log into the broker UAI and be directed to an end-user UAI as before.\n"

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes Warning: Permanently added '10.21.138.52' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

If the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory, as defined in LDAP had been mounted in the broker UAI and a .ssh/authorized_keys entry had been present, there would not have been a password prompt. Home directory trees can be mounted as volumes just as any other directory can. The broker mechanism in the broker UAI creates a new UAI because vers has never logged into this broker UAI before. There is a second prompt to acknowledge an unknown host which is, in this case, the end-user UAI itself. The broker UAI constructs a public/private key pair for the hidden SSH connection between the broker and the end-user UAI shown in the image in Broker Mode UAI Management.    Log out of the broker UAI.\n  Log in to the broker UAI again.\nThe next time vers logs in, it will look similar to the following:\nvers\u0026gt; ssh vers@10.103.13.162 Password: vers@uai-vers-ee6f427e-6c7468cdb8-2rqtv\u0026gt; Only the password prompt appears now, because the hosts are all known and the end-user UAI exists but there is no .ssh/authorized_keys known yet by the broker UAI for vers.\n  "

	"content": "Legacy Mode User-Driven UAI Management In the legacy mode, users create and manage their own UAIs through the Cray CLI. A user may create, list and delete only UAIs owned by the user. The user may not create a UAI for another user, nor may the user see or delete UAIs owned by another user. Once created, the information describing the UAI gives the user the information needed to reach the UAI using SSH and log into it.\nThe following diagram illustrates a system running with UAIs created in the legacy mode by four users, each of whom has created at least one end-user UAI. Notice that the example user Pat has created two end-user UAIs:\nIn the simplest UAS configuration, there is some number of UAI images available for use in legacy mode and there is a set of volumes defined. In this configuration, when a UAI is created, the user may specify the UAI image to use as an option when creating the UAI, or may allow a default UAI image, if one is assigned, to be used. Every volume defined at the time the UAI is created will be mounted unconditionally in every newly created UAI if this approach is used. This can lead to problems with conflicting volume mount points (see Troubleshoot Duplicate Mount Paths in a UAI) and unresolvable volumes (see Troubleshoot UAI Stuck in \u0026ldquo;ContainerCreating\u0026rdquo;) in some configurations of UAS. Unless UAI classes are used to make UAIs, care must be taken to ensure all volumes have unique mount-path settings and are accessible in the user Kubernetes namespace.\nThe Benefits of Using UAI Classes with Legacy Mode A slightly more sophisticated configuration approach defines a default UAI Class that is always used by legacy mode UAI creation. When this approach is taken, the user can no longer specify the image to use, as it will be supplied by the UAI class, and the volumes mounted in any UAI created in legacy mode will be based on the specified UAI class. As long as volumes do not conflict within the list of volumes in a given UAI class, there is no need to avoid duplicate mount-path settings in the global list of volumes when this approach is used.\n"

The default field is a flag indicating whether this class is the default class. The default class will be applied, overriding both the default UAI image and any specified image name, when the following command is used to create an end-user UAI for a user:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas create Setting a class to default gives the administrator fine grained control over the behavior of end-user UAIs that are created by authorized users in legacy mode (see Legacy Mode User-Driven UAI Management).\nThe remaining fields are as follows:\n The namespace field specifies the Kubernetes namespace in which this UAI will run. It has the default setting of user here. The opt_ports field is an empty list of TCP port numbers that will be opened on the external IP address of the UAI when it runs. This controls whether services other than SSH can be run and reached publicly on the UAI. The priority_class_name \u0026quot;uai_priority\u0026quot; is the default Kubernetes priority class of UAIs. If it were a different class, it would affect both Kubernetes default resource limit / request assignments and Kubernetes scheduling priority for the UAI. The public_ip field is a flag that indicates whether the UAI should be given an external IP address LoadBalancer service so that clients outside the Kubernetes cluster can reach it, or only be given a Kubernetes Cluster-IP address. For the most part, this controls whether the UAI is reachable by SSH from external clients, but it also controls whether the ports in opt_ports are reachable as well. The resource_config field is not set, but could be set to a resource specification to override namespace defaults on Kubernetes resource requests / limits. The uai_compute_network flag indicates whether this UAI uses the macvlan mechanism to gain access to the Shasta compute node network. This needs to be true to support workload management. The uai_creation_class field is used by broker UAIs to tell the broker what kind of UAI to create when automatically generating a UAI.  After all these individual items, we see the UAI Image to be used to create UAIs of this class:\n \u0026quot;uai_image\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;image_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ff86596e-9699-46e8-9d49-9cb20203df8c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;imagename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;registry.local/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest\u0026quot; }, Finally, there is a list of volumes that will show up in UAIs created using this class:\n \u0026quot;volume_mounts\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mount_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/etc/localtime\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volume_description\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;host_path\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/etc/localtime\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;FileOrCreate\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;volume_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;55a02475-5770-4a77-b621-f92c5082475c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volumename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;timezone\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;mount_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/lus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volume_description\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;host_path\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/lus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;DirectoryOrCreate\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;volume_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;9fff2d24-77d9-467f-869a-235ddcd37ad7\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volumename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lustre\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;mount_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/root/slurm_config/munge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volume_description\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;secret\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;secret_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;munge-secret\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;volume_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;7aeaf158-ad8d-4f0d-bae6-47f8fffbd1ad\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volumename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;munge-key\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;mount_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/etc/slurm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volume_description\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;config_map\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;slurm-map\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;volume_id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ea97325c-2b1d-418a-b3b5-3f6488f4a9e2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;volumename\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;slurm-config\u0026quot; } The timezone is taken from the host node by importing /etc/localtime to the UAI. Access is given to the Lustre file system mounted on the host node as /lus and mounting that within the UAI at the same path.Then, two pieces of Slurm configuration, the munge key and the slurm configuration file, are taken from Kubernetes and mounted as files at /root/slurm_config/munge and /etc/slurm respectively.\nSee UAI Classes and Elements of a UAI for more details on the output.\n"

JSON is the required input format for volume descriptions in UAS. Refer to Elements of a UAI for descriptions of mount_path, volume_description, volume_id, and volumename.\n  Looking at the above output, each volume has a mount_path, volume_description, volume_name and volume_id entry. The mount_path specifies where in the UAI the volume will be mounted.\nNOTE: While it is acceptable to have multiple volumes configured in UAS with the same mount_path, any given UAI will fail creation if it has more than one volume specified for a given mount path. If multiple volumes with the same mount path exist in the UAS configuration, all UAIs must be created using UAI classes that specify a workable subset of volumes. A UAI created without a UAI Class under such a UAS configuration will try to use all configured volumes and creation will fail.\nThe volume_description is the JSON description of the volume, specified as a dictionary with one entry, whose key identifies the kind of Kubernetes volume is described (i.e. host_path, configmap, secret, etc.) whose value is another dictionary containing the Kubernetes volume description itself. See Kubernetes documentation for details on what goes in various kinds of volume descriptions.\nThe volumename is a string the creator of the volume may chose to describe or name the volume. It must be comprised of only lower case alphanumeric characters and dashes ('-') and must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. It is used inside the UAI pod specification to identify the volume that is mounted in a given location in a container. It is required and administrators are free to use any name that meets the requirements. Volume names do need to be unique within any given UAI and are far more useful when searching for a volume if they are unique across the UAS configuration.\nThe volume_id is a unique identifier used to identify the UAS volume when examining, updating or deleting a volume and when linking a volume to a UAI class.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Customize the Broker UAI Image The broker UAI image that comes with UAS is the image used to construct broker UAIs.\nThe key pieces of the broker UAI image are:\n An entrypoint shell script that initializes the container and starts the SSH daemon running. An SSH configuration that forces logged in users into the switchboard command which creates / selects end-user UAIs and redirects connections.  The primary way to customize the broker UAI image is by defining volumes and connecting them to the broker UAI class for a given broker. An example of this is configuring the broker for LDAP is shown in Configure a Broker UAI Class. Some customizations may require action that cannot be covered simply by using a volume. Those cases can be covered either by volume mounting a customized entrypoint script, or volume mounting a customized SSH configuration. Both of these cases are shown in the following examples.\nCustomize the Broker UAI Entrypoint Script The broker UAI entrypoint script runs once every time the broker UAI starts. It resides at /app/broker/entrypoint.sh in the broker UAI image. The entrypoint script is the only file in that directory, so it can be overridden by creating a Kubernetes ConfigMap in the uas namespace containing the modified script and creating a volume using that ConfigMap with a mount point of /app/broker. There is critical content in the entrypoint script that should not be modified.\nThe following shows the contents of an unmodified script:\n#!/bin/bash # Copyright 2020 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP echo \u0026quot;Configure PAM to use sssd...\u0026quot; pam-config -a --sss --mkhomedir echo \u0026quot;Generating broker host keys...\u0026quot; ssh-keygen -A echo \u0026quot;Checking for UAI_CREATION_CLASS...\u0026quot; if ! [ -z $UAI_CREATION_CLASS ]; then echo UAI_CREATION_CLASS=$UAI_CREATION_CLASS \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/environment fi echo \u0026quot;Starting sshd...\u0026quot; /usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/switchboard/sshd_config echo \u0026quot;Starting sssd...\u0026quot; sssd sleep infinity Starting at the top, pam_config ... can be customized to set up PAM as needed. The configuration here assumes the broker is using SSSD to reach a directory server for authentication and that, if a home directory is not present for a user at login, one should be made on the broker. The ssh-keygen... part is needed to set up the SSH host key for the broker and should be left alone. The UAI_CREATION_CLASS code should be left alone, as it sets up information used by switchboard to create end-user UAIs. The /usr/sbin/sshd... part starts the SSH server on the broker and should be left alone. Configuration of SSH is covered in the next section and is done by replacing /etc/switchboard/sshd_config not by modifying this line. The sssd part assumes the broker is using SSSD to reach a directory server, it can be changed as needed. The sleep infinity prevents the script from exiting which keeps the broker UAI running. It should not be removed or altered. As long as the basic flow and contents described here are honored, other changes to this script should work without compromising the broker UAI\u0026rsquo;s function.\nThe following is an example of replacing the entrypoint script with a new entrypoint script that changes the SSSD invocation to explicitly specify the sssd.conf file path (the standard path is used here, but a different path might make customizing SSSD for a given site simpler under some set of circumstances):\n# Notice special here document form to prevent variable substitution in the file ncn-m001-pit# cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;EOF\u0026quot; \u0026gt; entrypoint.sh #!/bin/bash # Copyright 2020 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP echo \u0026quot;Configure PAM to use sssd...\u0026quot; pam-config -a --sss --mkhomedir echo \u0026quot;Generating broker host keys...\u0026quot; ssh-keygen -A echo \u0026quot;Checking for UAI_CREATION_CLASS...\u0026quot; if !

The UseDNS no avoids any DNS issues resulting from the broker UAI running in the Kubernetes network space. The permitTTY yes setting permits interactive UAI logins. The ForceCommand ... statement ensures that users are always sent on to end-user UAIs or drop out of the broker UAI on failure, preventing users from directly accessing the broker UAI. The AcceptEnv UAI_ONE_SHOT setting is not required, but it allows a user to set the UAI_ONE_SHOT variable which instructs the broker to delete any created end-user UAI after the user logs out.  These should be left unchanged. The rest of the configuration can be customized as needed.\nThe following is an example that follows on from the previous section and configures SSH to provide a pre-login banner.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Elements of a UAI All UAIs can have the following attributes associated with them:\n A required container image An optional set of volumes An optional resource specification An optional collection of other configuration items  This topic explains each of these attributes.\nUAI container image The container image for a UAI (UAI image) defines and provides the basic environment available to the user. This environment includes, among other things:\n The operating system (including version) Preinstalled packages  A site can customize UAI images and add those images to UAS, allowing them to be used for UAI creation. Any number of UAI images can be configured in UAS, though only one will be used by any given UAI.\nUAS provides two UAI images by default. These images enable HPE Cray EX administrators to set up UAIs and run many common tasks. The first image is a standard end-user UAI image that has the software necessary to support a basic Linux login experience. This image also comes with the Slurm and PBS Professional workload management client software installed. These clients allow users to take advantage of one or both of these workload managers if they are installed on the host system. The second image is a broker UAI image. Broker UAIs are a special type of UAIs used in the \u0026ldquo;broker based\u0026rdquo; operation model. Broker UAIs present a single SSH endpoint that every user logs into. The broker UAI then locates or creates a suitable end-user UAI and redirects the SSH session to that end-user UAI.\nUAI Volumes The volumes defined for a UAI provide external access to data provided by the host node. Anything that can be defined as a volume in a Kubernetes pod specification can be configured in UAS as a volume and used within a UAI. Examples include:\n Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets External file systems used for persistent storage or external data access Host node files and directories  When UAIs are created they mount a list of volumes inside their containers to give them access to various data provided either by Kubernetes resources or through Kubernetes by the host node where the UAI runs. Which volumes are in that list depends on how the UAI is created:\n UAIs not created using a UAI class mount all volumes configured in UAS. UAIs created using a class only mount the volumes listed in the class and configured in UAS.  The following are some example use cases for UAI volumes:\n Connecting UAIs to configuration files like /etc/localtime maintained by the host node. Connect end-user UAIs to Slurm or PBS Professional Workload Manager configuration shared through Kubernetes. Connecting end-user UAIs to Programming Environment libraries and tools hosted on the UAI host nodes. Connecting end-user UAIs to Lustre or other external storage for user data. Connecting broker UAIs to a directory service or SSH configuration to authenticate and redirect user sessions.  Every UAS volume includes the following values in its registration information:\n mount_path: Specifies where in the UAI the volume will be mounted. volume_description: A dictionary with one entry, whose key identifies the kind of Kubernetes volume is described (for example, host_path, configmap, secret). The value is another dictionary containing the Kubernetes volume description itself. volumename: A required string chosen by the creator of the volume. This may describe or name the volume. It is used inside the UAI pod specification to identify the volume that is mounted in a given location in a container. A volumename is unique within any given UAI, but not necessarily within UAS. These are useful when searching for a volume if they are unique across the UAS configuration. volume_id: Used to identify the UAS volume when examining, updating, or deleting a volume and when linking a volume to a UAI class. A volume_id is unique within UAS.  Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes for more information about Kubernetes volumes.\nResource Specifications A resource request tells Kubernetes the minimum amount of memory and CPU to give to each UAI. A resource limit sets the maximum amount that Kubernetes can give to any UAI. Kubernetes uses resource limits and requests to manage the system resources available to pods. Because UAIs run as pods under Kubernetes, UAS takes advantage of Kubernetes to manage the system resources available to UAIs. In UAS, resource specifications contain that configuration. A UAI that is assigned a resource specification will use that instead of the default resource limits or requests on the Kubernetes namespace containing the UAI. This way, resource specifications can be used to fine-tune resources assigned to UAIs.\nUAI resource specifications have three configurable parameters:\n A limit which is a JSON string describing a Kubernetes resource limit. A request which is a JSON string describing a Kubernetes resource request. An optional comment which is a free-form string containing any information an administrator might find useful about the resource specification.  Resource specifications also contain a resource-id that is used for examining, updating, or deleting the resource specification as well as linking the resource specification into a UAI class.\nResource specifications configured in UAS contain resource requests, limits, or both, that can be associated with a UAI. Any resource request or limit that can be set up on a Kubernetes pod can be set up as a resource specification under UAS.\nOther Configuration Items There are also smaller configuration items that control things such as:\n Whether the UAI can talk to compute nodes over the high-speed network (needed for workload management). Whether the UAI presents a public facing or private facing IP address for SSH. Kubernetes scheduling priority.  A UAI class template is required to configure such items.\nUAI Configuration and UAI Classes The container image for a UAI (UAI image), defines the basic environment including the flavor of operating system, the installed packages, and so forth available to the user. UAI images can be customized by a site and added to the UAS configuration to be used in UAI creation. Any number of UAI images can be configured in the UAS, though only one will be used by any given UAI. The UAS comes with some pre-defined UAI images that make it possible to set up UAIs and run many common tasks without further customization. Refer to Customize End-User UAI Images.\nThe volumes defined for a UAI provide for external access to data provided by the host system. Examples of this range from Kubernetes \u0026ldquo;configmaps\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;secrets\u0026rdquo; to external file systems used for persistent storage or external data access. Anything that can be defined as a volume in a Kubernetes pod specification can be configured in UAS as a volume and used within a UAI.\nResource requests and limits tell Kubernetes how much memory and CPU a given UAI wants all the time (request) and how much memory and CPU a UAI can ever be given (limit). Resource specifications configured into UAS contain resource requests and / or limits that can be associated with a UAI. Any resource request or limit that can be set up on a Kubernetes pod can be set up as a resource specification under UAS.\nThe smaller configuration items control things like whether the UAI can talk to compute nodes over the high-speed network (needed for workload management), whether the UAI presents a public facing or private facing IP address for SSH, Kubernetes scheduling priority and others.\nAll of the above can be customized on a given set of UAIs by defining a UAI class. UAI classes are templates used to create UAIs, and provide access to fine grained configuration and selection of image, volumes and resource specification. While an end-user UAI can be created by simply specifying its UAI image and the user\u0026rsquo;s public key, to make more precisely constructed UAIs a UAI class must be used.\n"

	"title": "End-user UAIs",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "End-User UAIs UAIs used for interactive logins are called end-user UAIs. End-user UAIs can be seen as lightweight User Access Nodes (UANs), but there are important differences between UAIs and UANs. First, end-user UAIs are not dedicated hardware like UANs. They are implemented as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, which makes them subject to Kubernetes scheduling and resource management rules. One key element of Kubernetes orchestration is impermanence. While end-user UAIs are often long running, Kubernetes can reschedule or recreate them as needed to meet resource and node availability constraints. UAIs can also be removed administratively. When either of these things happen, a new UAI may be created, but that new UAI reverts to its initial state, discarding any internal changes that might have been made in its previous incarnation. An administratively removed end-user UAI may or may not ever be re-created, and an end-user UAI that is preempted because of resource pressure may become unavailable for an extended time until the pressure is relieved.\nThe impermanence of end-user UAIs makes them suitable for tasks that are immediate and interactive over relatively short time frames, such as building and testing software or launching workloads. It makes them unsuitable for unattended activities like executing cron jobs or monitoring progress of a job in a logged-in shell unless those activities are built into the UAI image itself (more on custom UAI images later). These kinds of activities are more suited to UANs, which are more permanent and, unless they are re-installed, retain modified state through reboots and so forth.\nAnother way end-user UAIs differ from UANs is that any given end-user UAI is restricted to serving a single user. This protects users from interfering with each other within UAIs and means that any user who wants to use a UAI has to arrange for the UAI to be created and assigned. Once a user has an end-user UAI assigned, the user may initiate any number of SSH sessions to that UAI, but no other user will be recognized by the UAI when attempting to connect.\n"

	"content": "Customize End-User UAI Images The provided end-user UAI image is a basic UAI image that includes an up-to-date version of the Sles Linux Distribution and client support for both the Slurm and PBS Professional workload managers. It provides an entrypoint to using UAIs and doing workload management from UAIs. This UAI image is not suitable for use with the Cray PE because it cannot be assured of being up-to-date with what is running on Shasta compute nodes at a given site. To support building software to be run in compute nodes, it is necessary to create a custom end-user UAI image and use that.\nA custom end-user UAI image can be any container image set up with the end-user UAI entrypoint script. For this case, it will be a UAI image built from the squashfs image used on compute nodes on the host system. This section describes how to create this kind of custom end-user UAI image.\nPrerequisites  This procedure requires administrator privileges. All steps in this procedure must be run from a true NCN (master or worker node), not from the LiveCD node. In particular, pushing the final image to registry.local will fail with an error reporting a bad x509 certificate if it is attempted on the LiveCD node.  Procedure   Build a custom end-user UAI image.\nThe following steps are used to build a custom End-User UAI image called registry.local/cray/cray-uai-compute:latest. Alter this name as needed by changing the following in the procedure to use a different name:\nncn-w001# UAI_IMAGE_NAME=registry.local/cray/cray-uai-compute:latest   Query BOS for a sessiontemplate ID.\nIdentify the Sessiontemplate name to use. A full list may be found with the following command:\nncn-w001# cray bos sessiontemplate list --format yaml - boot_sets: compute: boot_ordinal: 2 etag: d54782b3853a2d8713a597d80286b93e kernel_parameters: ip=dhcp quiet spire_join_token=${SPIRE_JOIN_TOKEN} network: nmn node_roles_groups: - Compute path: s3://boot-images/0c0d4081-2e8b-433f-b6f7-e1ef0b907be3/manifest.json rootfs_provider: cpss3 rootfs_provider_passthrough: dvs:api-gw-service-nmn.local:300:nmn0 type: s3 cfs: configuration: wlm-config-0.1.0 enable_cfs: true name: wlm-sessiontemplate-0.1.0 Alternatively, collect the sessiontemplate name used during the Cray Operating System (COS) install. Refer to the \u0026ldquo;Boot COS\u0026rdquo; procedure in the COS product stream documentation. Near the end of that procedure, the step to create a BOS session to boot the compute nodes should contain the name.\nncn-w001# SESSION_NAME=wlm-sessiontemplate-0.1.0   Download a compute node SquashFS.\nUse the Sessiontemplate name to download a compute node squashfs from a BOS sessiontemplate name:\nncn-w001# SESSION_ID=$(cray bos sessiontemplate describe $SESSION_NAME --format json | jq -r '.boot_sets.compute.path' | awk -F/ '{print $4}') ncn-w001# cray artifacts get boot-images $SESSION_ID/rootfs rootfs.squashfs   Mount the SquashFS and create a tarball.\n  Create a directory to mount the SquashFS:\nncn-w001# mkdir -v mount ncn-w001# mount -v -o loop,ro rootfs.squashfs `pwd`/mount   Create the tarball.\nIMPORTANT: 99-slingshot-network.conf is omitted from the tarball as that prevents the UAI from running sshd as the UAI user with the su command:\nncn-w001# (cd `pwd`/mount; tar --xattrs --xattrs-include='*' --exclude=\u0026quot;99-slingshot-network.conf\u0026quot; -cf \u0026quot;../$SESSION_ID.tar\u0026quot; .) \u0026gt; /dev/null This may take several minutes. Notice that this does not create a compressed tarball. Using an uncompressed format makes it possible to add files if needed once the tarball is made. It also makes the procedure run just a bit more quickly.

	"content": "Add a Volume to UAS This procedure registers and configures a volume in UAS so that the volume can be mounted in UAIs.\nSee List Volumes Registered in UAS for examples of valid volume configurations. Refer to Elements of a UAI for descriptions of the volume configuration fields and values.\nNote the following caveats about adding volumes to UAS:\n A volume description may specify an underlying directory that is NFS-mounted on the UAI host nodes. Hard-mounted NFS file systems will stop responding indefinitely on references to their mount points if the NFS server fails or becomes unreachable from the UAI host node. This will cause new UAI creation and migration of existing UAIs to stop responding as well until the NFS issue is remedied. Multiple volumes can be configured in UAS with the same mount_path. UAS cannot create a UAI if that UAI has more than one volume specified for a given mount_path. If multiple volumes with the same mount_path exist in the UAS configuration all UAIs must be created using UAI classes that specify a workable subset of volumes. A UAI created without a UAI Class under such a UAS configuration will try to use all configured volumes and creation will fail. The volumename is a string that can describe or name the volume. It must be composed of only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes ('-'). The volumename also must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. As with UAI images, registering a volume with UAS creates the configuration that will be used to create a UAI. If the underlying object referred to by the volume does not exist at the time the UAI is created, the UAI will, in most cases, wait until the object becomes available before starting up. This will be visible in the UAI state which will eventually move to Waiting  Prerequisites Install and initialize the cray administrative CLI.\nProcedure To create a volume, follow this procedure.\n  Use the cray CLI to create the volume, specifying volumename, mount_path, and volume_description.\nNote difference between the UAS name for the volume type and the Kubernetes name for that type.

	"content": "Broker Mode UAI Management A UAI broker is a special kind of UAI whose job is not to host users directly but to field attempts to reach a UAI, locate or create a UAI for the user making the attempt, and then pass the connection on to the correct UAI. Multiple UAI brokers can be created, each serving a UAI of a different class, making it possible to set up UAIs for varying workflows and environments as needed. The following illustrates a system using the UAI broker mode of UAI management:\nUnlike in the legacy model, in this model users log into their UAIs through the UAI broker. After that, each user is assigned an end-user UAI by the broker and the SSH session is forwarded to the end-user UAI. This is seamless from the user\u0026rsquo;s perspective, as the SSH session is carried through the UAI broker and into the end-user UAI.\nTo make all of this work, the administrator must define at least one UAI class containing the configuration for the end-user UAIs to be created by the UAI broker and one UAI class containing the UAI broker configuration itself. The UAI broker should be configured by the site to permit authentication of users. Refer to the example in Configure a Broker UAI Class for more information. This can be carried out using volumes to place configuration files as needed in the file system namespace of the broker UAI. Finally, once all of this is prepared, the administrator launches the broker UAI, and makes the IP address of the broker UAI available for users to log into.\n"

	"content": "Configure a Broker UAI Class Configuring a broker UAI class consists of the following:\n Create volumes to hold any site-specific authentication, SSH, or other configuration required Choose the end-user UAI class for which the broker UAI will serve instances Create a UAI Class with (at a minimum):  namespace set to uas default set to false volume_mounts set to the list of customization volume-ids created above public_ip set to true uai_compute_network set to false uai_creation_class set to the class-id of the end-user UAI class    Example of Volumes to Connect Broker UAIs to LDAP Broker UAIs authenticate users in SSH, and pass the SSH connection on to the selected or created end-user UAI. An authentication source is required to authenticate users. For sites that use LDAP as a directory server for authentication, connecting broker UAIs to LDAP is simply a matter of replicating the LDAP configuration used by other nodes or systems at the site (UANs can be a good source of this configuration) inside the broker UAI. This section shows how to do that using volumes, which permits the standard broker UAI image to be used out of the box and reconfigured externally.\nWhile it would be possible to make the configuration available as files volume mounted from the host node of the broker UAI, this is difficult to set up and maintain because it means that the configuration files must be present and synchronized across all UAI host nodes. A more practical approach to this is to install the configuration files in Kubernetes as secrets, and then mount them from Kubernetes directly. This ensures that no matter where a broker UAI runs, it has access to the configuration.\nThis example, uses Kubernetes secrets and assumes that the broker UAIs run in the uas Kubernetes namespace. If a different namespace is used, the creation of the ConfigMaps is different but the contents are the same. Using a namespace other than uas for broker UAIs is not recommended and is beyond the scope of this document.\n  Configure LDAP and determine which files need to be changed in the broker UAI and what their contents should be.\nIn this example, the file is /etc/sssd/sssd.conf and its contents are (the contents have been sanitized, substitute appropriate contents in their place):\n[sssd] config_file_version = 2 services = nss, pam domains = My_DC [nss] filter_users = root filter_groups = root [pam] [domain/My_DC] ldap_search_base=dc=datacenter,dc=mydomain,dc=com ldap_uri=ldap://10.1.1.5,ldap://10.1.2.5 id_provider = ldap ldap_tls_reqcert = allow ldap_schema = rfc2307 cache_credentials = True entry_cache_timeout = 60 enumerate = False   Add the content from the previous step to a secret.\n  Create a file with the appropriate content.\nncn-m001-pit# cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; sssd.conf [sssd] config_file_version = 2 services = nss, pam domains = My_DC [nss] filter_users = root filter_groups = root [pam] [domain/My_DC] ldap_search_base=dc=datacenter,dc=mydomain,dc=com ldap_uri=ldap://10.1.1.5,ldap://10.1.2.5 id_provider = ldap ldap_tls_reqcert = allow ldap_schema = rfc2307 cache_credentials = True entry_cache_timeout = 60 enumerate = False EOF   Make a secret from the file.\nncn-m001-pit# kubectl create secret generic -n uas broker-sssd-conf --from-file=sssd.conf     Make a volume for the secret in the UAS configuration.\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin config volumes create --mount-path /etc/sssd --volume-description '{\u0026quot;secret\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;secret_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;broker-sssd-conf\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;default_mode\u0026quot;: 384}}' --volumename broker-sssd-config mount_path = \u0026quot;/etc/sssd\u0026quot;

Two important things to notice here are:\n The secret is mounted on the directory /etc/sssd not the file /etc/sssd/sssd.conf because Kubernetes does not permit the replacement of an existing regular file with a volume but does allow overriding a directory The value 384 is used here for the default mode of the file instead of 0600, which would be easier to read, because JSON does not accept octal numbers in the leading zero form    Obtain the information needed to create a UAI class for the broker UAI containing the updated configuration in the volume list.\nThe image-id of the broker UAI image, the volume-ids of the volumes to be added to the broker class, and the class-id of the end-user UAI class managed by the broker are required:\nncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin config images list [[results]] default = false image_id = \u0026quot;c5dcb261-5271-49b3-9347-afe7f3e31941\u0026quot;

Remove the image with the following command:\nncn-m001# cray ims images delete 4871cb4a-e055-4131-a228-c0a26f0903cd   Remove the imported IMS recipes using the ID of each recipe in the recipes mapping.\nThe example in step 1 includes one recipe with the id = 5f5a74e0-108e-4159-9699-47dd2a952205 value. Remove the image with the following command:\nncn-m001# cray ims recipes delete 5f5a74e0-108e-4159-9699-47dd2a952205   Remove the Gitea repositories or branches.\nTo delete a Git branch as specified in the product catalog, follow the external instructions to delete Git remote branches. The branch name is located in the import_branch field.\nIf only one version of the product exists (as in the CSM example), the user can remove the entire repository instead of a single branch. Gitea repositories can be removed via the Gitea web interface or via the Gitea REST API.\nGitea web interface:\n1. Log in to Gitea as the *crayvcs* user. 1. From the dashboard, select the repository to delete based on the name of the repository in the *clone_url* field of the product catalog. 2. Click on \u0026quot;Settings\u0026quot; and scroll to the bottom of the page to the \u0026quot;Danger Zone\u0026quot; section. Follow the instructions to delete the repository.  Gitea REST API:\nRun the following commands on a CSM Kubernetes master or worker node, replacing the name of the repository in the second command.\nncn-m001# VCSPWD=$(kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials \\ --template={{.data.vcs_password}} | base64 --decode) ncn-m001# curl -X DELETE -u crayvcs:${VCSPWD} \\ https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/api/v1/repos/cray/{name of repository}   Update the product catalog.\nOnce the images, recipes, and repositories/branches have been removed from the system, update the product catalog to remove the references to them. This is done by editing the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap.\nncn-m001# kubectl edit configmap -n services cray-product-catalog In the editor, delete the entries for the artifacts that were deleted on the system for the specific version of the product. In this example, all artifacts were deleted and only a single product version exists, so the entire entry in the product catalog for the CSM product can be deleted. Save the changes and exit the editor to persist the changes in the ConfigMap.\n  "

	"content": "Configure Non-Compute Nodes with CFS Non-compute node (NCN) personalization applies post-boot configuration to the HPE Cray EX management nodes. Several HPE Cray EX product environments outside of CSM require NCN personalization to function. Consult the manual for each product to configure them on NCNs by referring to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center.\nThis procedure defines the NCN personalization process for the CSM product using the Configuration Framework Service (CFS).\nDuring a fresh install, carry out these procedures in order. Later, individual procedures may be re-run as needed.\n Set up passwordless SSH  Option 1: Use the CSM-provided SSH keys Option 2: Provide custom SSH keys Option 3: Disable CSM-provided passwordless SSH Restore CSM-provided SSH keys   Configure the root password in Vault Run NCN personalization  1. Set up passwordless SSH This procedure should be run during CSM installation and any later time when the SSH keys need to be changed per site requirements.\nThe goal of passwordless SSH is to enable an easy way for interactive passwordless SSH from and between CSM product environments (management nodes) to downstream managed product environments (COS, UAN, etc), without requiring each downstream environment to create and apply individual changes to NCNs. Passwordless SSH from downstream nodes into CSM management nodes is not intended or supported.\nPasswordless SSH keypairs for the Cray System Management (CSM) are created automatically and maintained with a Kubernetes deployment and staged into Kubernetes secrets (csm-private-key) and ConfigMaps (csm-public-key) in the services namespace. Administrators can use these provided keys, provide their own keys, or use their own solution for authentication.\nThe management of keys on NCNs is achieved by the trust-csm-ssh-keys and passwordless-ssh Ansible roles in the CSM configuration management repository. The SSH keypair is applied to management nodes using NCN personalization.\nOption 1: Use the CSM-provided SSH keys The default CSM Ansible plays are already configured to enable Passwordless SSH by default. No further action is necessary before proceeding to Configure the root password in Vault.\nOption 2: Provide custom SSH keys Administrators may elect to replace the CSM-provided keys with their own custom keys.\n  Set variables to the locations of the public and private SSH key files.\n Replace the values in the examples below with the paths to the desired key files on the system.\n ncn# PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=/path/to/id_rsa-csm.pub ncn# PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/id_rsa-csm   Provide the custom keys by script or manually.\nThere are two options for providing the keys.\n  Provide custom SSH keys by script.\nThe replace_ssh_keys.sh script can be used to replace the keys from files.\n The docs-csm RPM must be installed in order to use this script. See Check for Latest Documentation\n ncn# /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/operations/configuration/replace_ssh_keys.sh \\  --public-key-file \u0026#34;${PUBLIC_KEY_FILE}\u0026#34; --private-key-file \u0026#34;${PRIVATE_KEY_FILE}\u0026#34;   Manually provide custom SSH keys\nThe keys stored in Kubernetes can be updated directly.\n  Replace the private key half:\nncn# KEY64=$(cat \u0026#34;${PRIVATE_KEY_FILE}\u0026#34; | base64) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; kubectl get secret -n services csm-private-key -o json | \\  jq --arg value \u0026#34;$KEY64\u0026#34; \u0026#39;.data[\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;]=$value\u0026#39; | kubectl apply -f - \u0026amp;\u0026amp; unset KEY64   Replace the public key half:\nncn# kubectl delete configmap -n services csm-public-key \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cat \u0026#34;${PUBLIC_KEY_FILE}\u0026#34; | base64 \u0026gt; ./value \u0026amp;\u0026amp; kubectl create configmap --from-file value csm-public-key --namespace services \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm ./value       Passwordless SSH with the provided keys will be setup once NCN personalization runs on the NCNs.\nProceed Configure the root password in Vault.\nOption 3: Disable CSM-provided passwordless SSH Local site security requirements may preclude use of passwordless SSH access between management nodes. If this is the case, remove or comment out the invocation of the trust-csm-public-keys role in Ansible plays in the configuration repositories of the environments where it is configured. By default, the HPE Cray Operating System (COS) and User Access Node (UAN) configurations enable passwordless SSH. Refer to the following in the documentation for each product stream to change the default configuration:\n COS: Refer to the VCS Configuration section in the Install or Upgrade COS procedure. UAN: Refer to Create UAN Boot Images and UAN Ansible Roles procedures.  Modifying Ansible plays in a configuration repository will require a new commit and subsequent update of the configuration layer associated with the product.\n NOTE: CFS itself does not use the CSM-provided (or user-supplied) SSH keys to make connections between nodes. CFS will continue to function if passwordless SSH is disabled between CSM and other product environments.\n Proceed Configure the root password in Vault.\nRestore CSM-provided SSH keys  Use this procedure if switching from custom keys to the default CSM SSH keys only; otherwise it should be skipped.\n The keys can be deleted from Kubernetes directly. The csm-ssh-keys Kubernetes deployment provided by CSM periodically checks the ConfigMap and secret containing the key information. If these entries do not exist, it will recreate them from the default CSM keys. Therefore, in order to manually restore the keys, delete the associated ConfigMap and secret. The default CSM-provided keys will be republished.\n  Delete the csm-private-key Kubernetes secret.\nncn# kubectl delete secret -n services csm-private-key   Delete the csm-public-key Kubernetes ConfigMap.\nncn# kubectl delete configmap -n services csm-public-key   2. Configure the root password in Vault The root password is applied to NCNs by using the csm.password Ansible role located in the CSM configuration management repository. root passwords are set and managed in Vault.\n Set the password in Vault by following the Configure Root Password in Vault procedure in Update NCN Passwords. Apply the Vault password to the NCNs in the NCN personalization procedure.  3. Run NCN personalization Prior to running NCN personalization, gather the following information:\n HTTP clone URL for the configuration repository in VCS. Path to the Ansible play to run in the repository. Git commit ID in the repository for CFS to pull and run on the nodes.     Field Value Description     cloneUrl https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/csm-config-management.git CSM configuration repository   commit Example: 5081c1ecea56002df41218ee39f6030c3eebdf27 CSM configuration commit hash   name Example: csm-1.9.21 CSM configuration layer name   playbook site.yml Default site-wide Ansible playbook for CSM      Retrieve the commit in the repository to use for configuration. If changes have been made to the default branch that was imported during a CSM installation or upgrade, use the commit containing the changes.\n  If no changes have been made, then the latest commit on the default branch for this version of CSM should be used.

	"content": "Introduction to CSM Installation This document provides an introduction to the Cray System Management (CSM) installation documentation for an HPE Cray EX system.\nTopics:  CSM Overview Scenarios for Shasta v1.5 CSM Product Stream Updates CSM Operational Activities Differences from Previous Release Documentation Conventions  Details CSM Overview The CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage. These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.\nSystem services on these nodes are provided as containerized micro-services packaged for deployment as helm charts. These services are orchestrated by Kubernetes to be scheduled on Kubernetes worker nodes with horizontal scaling to increase or decrease the number of instances of some services as demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.\nThere is much more information available in the CSM Overview about the hardware, software, network, and access to these services and components.\nSee CSM Overview\nScenarios for Shasta v1.5 These scenarios for how to get CSM software onto a system are described in Scenarios for Shasta v1.5.\n Installation of CSM software  First time installation of CSM software Reinstall of CSM software   Upgrade from a previous version of CSM software  Note: A migration from Shasta v1.3.x software to Shasta v1.5 software is not supported as a direct action, but is a two step process of first migrating from Shasta v1.3.x to Shasta v1.4 and then following the Upgrade procedure from v1.4 to v1.5.\nSee Scenarios for Shasta v1.5\nCSM Product Stream Updates The software included in the CSM product stream is released in more than one way. The initial product release may be augmented with late-breaking workarounds and documentation updates or hotfixes after the release.\nSee CSM Product Stream Updates\nCSM Operational Activities Procedures which are used during either installation or upgrading of software or in both, but which may also be used for general operation of the system reside here. They are referenced in the context of the installation workflow. For example, updating firmware with FAS or running the CSM health checks.\nSee CSM Operational Activities\nDifferences from Previous Release Significant changes from the previous release of CSM are described.\n New Features Deprecating Features Deprecated Features Other Changes  See Differences from Previous Release\nDocumentation Conventions Several conventions have been used in the preparation of this documentation.\n File Formats Typographic Conventions Command Prompt Conventions which indicate the context for user, host, directory, chroot environment, or container environment  See Documentation Conventions\n"

	"content": "Perform NCN Personalization NCN personalization is the process of applying product-specific configuration to NCNs post-boot.\nPrerequisites Prior to running this procedure, gather the following information required by CFS to create a configuration layer:\n HTTP clone URL for the configuration repository in VCS Path to the Ansible play to run in the repository Commit ID in the repository for CFS to pull and run on the nodes  Products may supply multiple plays to run, in which case multiple configuration layers must be created. Consult the manual for each product to configure them on NCNs by referring to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center.\nProcedure: Perform NCN Personalization Determine if NCN Personalization CFS Configuration Exists If upgrading a product to a new version, an NCN personalization configuration in CFS should already exist. By default, the configuration is named ncn-personalization. If the default name is not used, substitute that name in the steps below.\n Determine if a configuration already exists. ncn# cray cfs configurations describe ncn-personalization --format json \u0026gt; ncn-personalization.json   If the configuration exists, the ncn-personalization.json file will be created and populated with previously defined configuration layers. If it does not exist, the file will be created empty and the command will respond with an error. This error can be ignored.\nAdd Layer(s) to the CFS Configuration CFS executes configuration layers in order. Refer to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center at https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg to determine if the configuration layer requires special placement in the layer list.\n NOTE: The CSM configuration layer MUST be the first layer in the NCN personalization CFS configuration.\n  Add a configuration layer to the ncn-personalization.json file. Follow the appropriate step based on if an NCN personalization CFS configuration exists:  If the ncn-personalization.json file is empty, overwrite the file with the configuration layer(s) information gathered from the product that is configuring the NCNs. Use the sample file with a single layer as a template. If a CFS configuration exists with one or more layers, add (or replace) the corresponding layer entry(ies) with the configuration layer information gathered for this specific product. For example: ncn# cat ncn-personalization.json { \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34;: [ # ... { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;product-release-etc\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cloneUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/vcs/cray/\u0026lt;product\u0026gt;-config-management.git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;playbook\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;site.yml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;commit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;git commit\u0026gt;\u0026#34; }, # ... ] }     Create/Update the NCN Personalization CFS Configuration Layer  Upload the configuration file to CFS to update or create the ncn-personalization CFS configuration. ncn# cray cfs configurations update ncn-personalization --file ncn-personalization.json --format json { \u0026#34;lastUpdated\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-07-28T03:26:01Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34;: [ { ... layer information here ... }, ], \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ncn-personalization\u0026#34; }   Set the Desired Configuration on NCNs   Update the desired configuration for all NCNs.\nncn# for xname in $(cray hsm state components list --role Management --format json | jq -r .Components[].ID) do cray cfs components update --desired-config ncn-personalization --enabled true --format json $xname done After this command is issued, the CFS Batcher service will dispatch a CFS session to configure the NCNs. Since the NCN is now managed by CFS by setting a desired configuration, the same will happen every time the NCN boots.\n  Query the status of the NCN Personalization process. The status will be pending while the node is being configured by CFS, and will change to configured when the configuration has completed.\nncn# for xname in $(cray hsm state components list \\  --role Management --format json | jq -r .Components[].ID) do cray cfs components describe --format json $xname | jq -r \u0026#39; .id+\u0026#34; status=\u0026#34;+.configurationStatus\u0026#39; done x3000c0s17b0n0 status=configured x3000c0s19b0n0 status=pending x3000c0s21b0n0 status=configured ... The NCN personalization step is complete and the NCNs are now configured as specified in the ncn-personalization configuration layers when each node\u0026rsquo;s status is configured.\nSee Configuration Management of System Components for more information on setting desired configuration on specific nodes using CFS.\n  Procedure: Re-Run NCN Personalization If no changes have been made to the configuration layers (such as a new layer, different playbook, or new commit made), but NCN personalization needs to be run again, CFS can re-run NCN personalization on specific nodes.\nRe-run the configuration for an NCN by clearing the state of the node. Clearing the node state will cause CFS to reconfigure the node, so long as the desired configuration was set previously.\n  Clear the state and error count of the node using CFS.\nReplace the \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; string in the following command with the xname of the node being reconfigured.\nncn# cray cfs components update --error-count 0 --state \u0026#39;[]\u0026#39; --format json \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt;   (Optional) To re-run NCN personalization on all NCNs at once, use the following loop:\nncn# for xname in $(cray hsm state components list \\  --role Management --format json | jq -r .Components[].ID) do cray cfs components update --error-count 0 --state \u0026#39;[]\u0026#39; --format json $xname done   "

	"content": "Post-Install Customizations Post-install customizations may be needed as systems scale. These customizations also need to persist across future installs or upgrades. Not all resources can be customized post-install; common scenarios are documented in the following sections.\nThe following is a guide for determining where issues may exist, how to adjust the resources, and how to ensure the changes will persist. Different values may be be needed for systems as they scale.\nkubectl events OOMKilled Check to see if there are any recent out of memory events.\n  Check kubectl events to see if there are any recent out of memory events.\nncn# kubectl get event -A | grep OOM   Log in to Grafana.\nhttps://grafana.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/   Search for the \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod\u0026rdquo; dashboard to view the memory utilization graphs over time for any pod that has been OOMKilled.\n  Prometheus CPUThrottlingHigh alerts Check Prometheus for recent CPUThrottlingHigh alerts.\n  Log in to Prometheus.\nhttps://prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/   Select the Alert tab.\n  Scroll down to the alert for CPUThrottlingHigh.\n    Log in to Grafana.\nhttps://grafana.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/   Search for the \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod\u0026rdquo; dashboard to view the throttling graphs over time for any pod that is alerting.\n  Grafana \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod\u0026rdquo; dashboard Use Grafana to investigate and analyze CPU throttling and memory usage.\n  Log in to Grafana.\nhttps://grafana.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME/   Search for the \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Pod\u0026rdquo; dashboard.\n  Select the datasource, namespace, and pod based on the pod being examined.\nFor example:\ndatasource: default namespace: sysmgmt-health pod: prometheus-cray-sysmgmt-health-promet-prometheus-0   CPU throttling   Select the CPU Throttling drop-down to see the CPU Throttling graph for the pod during the selected time (from the top right).\n  Select the container (from the legends under the x axis).\n  Review the graph and adjust the resources.limits.cpu value as needed.\nThe presence of CPU throttling does not always indicate a problem, but if a service is being slow or experiencing latency issues, adjusting resources.limits.cpu may be beneficial.\nFor example:\n If the pod is being throttled at or near 100% for any period of time, then adjustments are likely needed. If the service\u0026rsquo;s response time is critical, then adjusting the pod\u0026rsquo;s resources to greatly reduce or eliminate any CPU throttling may be required.   NOTE: The resources.requests.cpu values are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to decide which node to place the pod on and do not impact CPU throttling. The value of resources.limits.cpu can never be lower than the value of resources.requests.cpu.\n   Memory usage   Select the Memory Usage drop-down to see the memory usage graph for the pod during the selected time (from the top right).\n  Select the container (from the legends under the x axis).\n  Determine the steady state memory usage by looking at the memory usage graph for the container.\nThis is where the resources.requests.memory value should be minimally set. But more importantly, determine the spike usage for the container and set the resources.limits.memory value based on the spike values with some additional headroom.\n  Common customization scenarios  Prerequisites Prometheus pod is OOMKilled or CPU throttled Postgres pods are OOMKilled or CPU throttled Scale cray-bss service Postgres PVC resize  Prerequisites In order to apply post-install customizations to a system, the affected Helm chart must exist on the system so that the same chart version can be redeployed with the desired customizations.\nThis example unpacks the the csm-1.0.0 tarball under /root and lists the Helm charts that are now on the system. Set PATH_TO_RELEASE to the release directory where the helm directory exists. PATH_TO_RELEASE will be used below when deploying a customization.\nThese unpacked files can be safely removed after the customizations are deployed through loftsman ship in the examples below.\n## This example assumes the csm-1.0.1 release is currently running and the csm-1.0.1.tar.gz has been pulled down under /root ncn# cd /root ncn# tar -xzf csm-1.0.1.tar.gz ncn# rm csm-1.0.1.tar.gz ncn# PATH_TO_RELEASE=/root/csm-1.0.1 ncn# ls $PATH_TO_RELEASE/helm Prometheus pod is OOMKilled or CPU throttled Update resources associated with Prometheus in the sysmgmt-health namespace.

	"content": "Scenarios for Shasta v1.5 There are multiple scenarios for installing CSM software which are described in this documentation with many supporting procedures.\n Scenarios for Shasta v1.5  Installation Upgrade Migration    Installation There are two ways to install the CSM software. There are some differences between a first time install which must create the initial configuration payload and configure the management network switches, whereas a reinstall can reuse a previous configuration payload and skip the configuration of management network switches. The first time install will check and then may update firmware for various components whereas the reinstall will check and indicate that no firmware update is required. There are two different ways to use the LiveCD, either from a RemoteISO or a USB device, which are described in Bootstrap PIT Node. There are a few places where a comment will be made in a procedure for how one of the scenarios needs to do something different.\n  First time Install\n Prepare Configuration Payload creates the initial configuration payload. Bootstrap PIT Node Configure Management Network Switches    Reinstall\n Prepare Configuration Payload can reuse a previous configuration payload. There may be additional steps to manually wipe disks on the management nodes and do other actions to prepare the management node hardware for the reinstall. Bootstrap PIT Node Can skip the procedure to Configure Management Network Switches    The two paths merge together after configuration of the management network switches to do later actions the same regardless of the starting point in the workflow.\n Deploy Management Nodes Install CSM Services Validate CSM Health Before PIT Node Redeploy Redeploy PIT Node Configure Administrative Access Validate CSM Health Update Firmware with FAS Prepare Compute Nodes  After completion of the firmware update with FAS and the preparation of compute nodes, the CSM product stream has been fully installed and configured. Refer to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center at https://www.hpe.com/support/ex-gsg for more information on other product streams to be installed and configured after CSM.\nSee Install CSM for the details on the installation process for either a first time install or a reinstall..\nUpgrade The upgrade from Shasta v1.4.2 (including CSM 0.9.3) to Shasta v1.5 (including CSM 1.0.1) is supported. This process will upgrade the Ceph storage software, then the storage nodes, then the Kubernetes master nodes and worker nodes, and finally the CSM services. The management nodes are upgraded using a rolling upgrade approach which enables management services to continue to function even as one or a few nodes are being upgraded.\nSee Upgrade CSM.\nMigration There is no direct migration from Shasta v1.3.x releases to Shasta v1.5. However there is a supported path.\n  Migration from v1.3.x to v1.4.0\nThe migration from v1.3.x to v1.4.0 is described in the Shasta v1.4 documentation. Refer to \u0026ldquo;1.3 to 1.4 Install Prerequisites\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Collect Data From Healthy Shasta 1.3 System for EX 1.4 Installation\u0026rdquo; in the HPE Cray EX System Installation and Configuration Guide 1.4 S-8000.\n  Upgrade v1.4.x to v1.5\nAn upgrade from the previous release (Shasta v1.4.x) is supported with this release.\nSee Upgrade from 1.4.x to v1.5\n  "

	"content": "Site Survey Worksheet This site survey worksheet identifies information which should be collected in advance of a CSM installation.\nTopics  First master node Site time information Site DNS information CAN network ranges Default internal network ranges SHCD csi command line configuration payload csi configuration payload files site-init customizations Application nodes Filesystems  1. First master node (ncn-m001) The first master node (ncn-m001) is also called the PIT node early in the installation process, but later becomes ncn-m001.\n   Name Value     Factory-installed Linux root password of ncn-m001    Site-defined Linux root password of ncn-m001    BMC or iLO username for ncn-m001    BMC or iLO password for ncn-m001    BMC or iLO IP address of ncn-m001 on site BMC network    BMC or iLO default route/gateway for ncn-m001 on site BMC network    BMC or iLO netmask for ncn-m001 on site BMC network    IP address for ncn-m001 primary Ethernet on site network    Default route/gateway for ncn-m001 primary Ethernet on site network    Netmask for ncn-m001 primary Ethernet on site network    Network interface ncn-m001 primary Ethernet to become lan0     2. Site time information    Name Value     Time zone    First site NTP server    (Optional) Second site NTP server    (Optional) Third site NTP server     3. Site DNS information    Name Value     Domain name    System name    First site DNS server IP address    (Optional) Second site DNS server IP address    (Optional) Third site DNS server IP address      Note: The name of the system becomes part of the subdomain which is used to access externally exposed services. For example, if the system is named testsystem, and the domain name is example.com, the subdomain would be testsystem.example.com. Site DNS would need to be configured to delegate requests for addresses in this domain to the DNS IP address on CAN for resolution.\n 4. CAN network ranges Site must provide an IP address range for the Customer Access Network (CAN) and its subnets.\n   Name Starting IP Address Netmask     CAN     can-static-pool     can-dynamic-pool     DNS IP address on CAN     CAN gateway IP address       Notes:\n The DNS IP address on the CAN is the IP address used for the HPE Cray EX DNS service. Site DNS delegates the resolution for addresses in the HPE Cray EX Domain to this server. This IP address must be in the can-static-pool subnet. The CAN gateway IP address is the IP address assigned to a specific port on the spine switch or edge switch, which will act as the gateway between the CAN and the rest of the customer\u0026rsquo;s internal networks. This address would be the last hop route to the CAN network.   5. Default internal network ranges The initial installation of the system creates default networks with default settings and with no external exposure. These default IP address ranges ensure that no nodes in the system attempt to use the same IP address as a Kubernetes service or pod, which would result in undefined behavior that is extremely difficult to reproduce or debug.\nThe following table shows the default IP address ranges.\n   Network Default IP Address Range Site Value (if not default)     Kubernetes service network 10.16.0.0/12    Kubernetes pod network 10.32.0.0/12    Install network (MTL) 10.1.0.0/16    Node Management Network (NMN) 10.252.0.0/17    High Speed Network (HSN) 10.253.0.0/16    Hardware Management Network (HMN) 10.254.0.0/17    Mountain NMN allocate a /22 from this range per liquid-cooled cabinet 10.100.0.0/17    Mountain HMN allocate a /22 from this range per liquid-cooled cabinet 10.104.0.0/17    River NMN 10.106.0.0/17    River HMN 10.107.0.0/17      Note: Example NMN 10.100.0.0/17and HMN 10.104.0.0/17 default IP address ranges for a Mountain system with three cabinets would be:\n   Cabinet number NMN Default IP Address Range Site Value (if not default)     1 10.100.0.0/22    2 10.100.4.0/22    3 10.100.8.0/22        Cabinet number HMN Default IP Address Range Site Value (if not default)     1 10.104.0.0/22    2 10.104.4.0/22    3 10.104.8.0/22      6. SHCD The Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) is a multiple tab spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing with much information about the HPE Cray EX system and its components. Included in the SHCD are:\n A configuration summary with revision history Floor layout plan with cabinet ID numbers Type and location of components in the air-cooled cabinets Type and location of components in the liquid-cooled cabinets Device diagrams for switches and nodes in the cabinets List of source and destination of every HSN cable List of source and destination of every cable connected to the spine switches List of source and destination of every cable connected to the NMN List of source and destination of every cable connected to the HMN List of cabling for the KVM Routing of power to the PDUs  The installation of CSM software requires that the SHCD be available. Some information will be manually collected from the SHCD, but some of the tabs can be extracted into CSV formatted files tor use as input to automatic configuration tools.\n7. csi command line configuration payload This information from a site survey can be given to the csi command as command line arguments. The information is shown here to explain what data is needed.\nThe air-cooled cabinet is known to csi as a river cabinet. The liquid-cooled cabinets are either mountain or hill (if a TDS system).\n   CSI Option Example Information Site Value     --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user root Administrative account for the management node BMCs    --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass changeme Password for bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user account    --system-name eniac Name of the HPE Cray EX system    --mountain-cabinets 4 Number of Mountain cabinets, but this could also be in cabinets.yaml    --starting-mountain-cabinet 1000 Starting Mountain cabinet ID    --hill-cabinets 0 Number of Hill cabinets, but this could also be in cabinets.yaml    --river-cabinets 1 Number of River cabinets, but this could also be in cabinets.yaml    --can-cidr 10.103.11.0/24 IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system    --can-external-dns 10.103.11.113 IP address on CAN for this system\u0026rsquo;s DNS server    --can-gateway 10.103.11.1 Virtual IP address for the CAN (on the spine switches)    --can-static-pool 10.103.11.112/28 MetalLB static pool on CAN    --can-dynamic-pool 10.103.11.128/25 MetalLB dynamic pool on CAN    --hmn-cidr 10.254.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for River HMN    --nmn-cidr 10.252.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for River NMN    --hmn-mtn-cidr 10.104.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for Mountain HMN    --nmn-mtn-cidr 10.100.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for Mountain NMN    --ntp-pools time.nist.gov External NTP pool for pools for this system to use    --site-domain dev.cray.com Domain name for this system    --site-ip 172.30.53.79/20 IP address and netmask for the PIT node lan0 connection    --site-gw 172.30.48.1 Gateway for the PIT node to use    --site-nic p1p2 NIC on the PIT node to become lan0    --site-dns 172.30.84.40 Site DNS servers to be used by the PIT node    --install-ncn-bond-members p1p1,p10p1 NICs on each management node to become bond0    --application-node-config-yaml application_node_config.yaml Name of application_node_config.yaml    --cabinets-yaml cabinets.yaml Name of cabinets.yaml    --bgp-peers aggregation Override the default BGP peers, using aggregation switches instead of spines      The bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user and bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass must match what is used for the BMC account and its password for the management nodes. Set site parameters (site-domain, site-ip, site-gw, site-nic, site-dns) for the information which connects ncn-m001 (the PIT node) to the site. The site-nic is the interface on this node connected to the site. There are other interfaces possible, but the install-ncn-bond-members are typically:  p1p1,p10p1 for HPE nodes p1p1,p1p2 for Gigabyte nodes p801p1,p801p2 for Intel nodes   The starting cabinet number for each type of cabinet (for example, starting-mountain-cabinet) has a default that can be overridden. See the csi config init --help output for more information. An override to default cabinet IPv4 subnets can be made with the hmn-mtn-cidr and nmn-mtn-cidr parameters. Several parameters (can-gateway, can-cidr, can-static-pool, can-dynamic-pool) describe the CAN (Customer Access network).  The can-gateway is the common gateway IP address used for both spine switches and commonly referred to as the Virtual IP address for the CAN. The can-cidr is the IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system. The can-static-pool and can-dynamic-pool are the MetalLB address static and dynamic pools for the CAN. The can-external-dns is the static IP address assigned to the DNS instance running in the cluster to which requests the cluster subdomain will be forwarded. The can-external-dns IP address must be within the can-static-pool range.   Set ntp-pools to reachable NTP pools. The application_node_config.yaml file is required. It is used to describe the mapping between prefixes in hmn_connections.csv and HSM subroles. This file also defines aliases application nodes. For details, see Create Application Node YAML. For systems that use non-sequential cabinet ID numbers, use cabinets-yaml to include the cabinets.yaml file. This file can include information about the starting ID for each cabinet type and number of cabinets which have separate command line options, but is a way to specify explicitly the ID of every cabinet in the system. See ../install/Create Cabinets YAML.  csi configuration payload files A few configuration files are needed for the installation of CSM. These are all provided to the csi command during the installation process.\n   Filename Source Information     cabinets.yaml SHCD The number and type of air-cooled and liquid-cooled cabinets, cabinet IDs, and VLAN numbers   application_node_config.yaml SHCD The number and type of application nodes with mapping from the name in the SHCD to the desired hostname   hmn_connections.json SHCD The network topology for HMN of the entire system   ncn_metadata.csv SHCD, other The number of master, worker, and storage nodes and MAC address information for BMC and bootable NICs   switch_metadata.csv SHCD Inventory of all spine, aggregation, CDU, and leaf switches    Although some information in these files can be populated from site survey information, the SHCD prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing is the best source of data for hmn_connections.json. The ncn_metadata.csv does require collection of MAC addresses from the management nodes because that information is not present in the SHCD.\ncabinets.yaml The cabinets.yaml file describes the type of cabinets in the system, the number of each type of cabinet, and the starting cabinet ID for every cabinet in the system. This file can be used to indicate that a system has non-contiguous cabinet ID numbers or non-standard VLAN numbers.\nThe component names (xnames) used in the other files should fit within the cabinet IDs defined by the starting cabinet ID for River cabinets (modified by the number of cabinets). It is OK for management nodes not to be in x3000 (as the first River cabinet), but they must be in one of the River cabinets. For example, x3000 with two cabinets would mean x3000 or x3001 should have all management nodes.\nSee Create Cabinets YAML for instructions about creating this file.\napplication_node_config.yaml The application_node_config.yaml file controls how the csi config init command finds and treats application nodes discovered in the hmn_connections.json file when building the SLS input file.\nDifferent node prefixes in the SHCD can be identified as application nodes. Each node prefix can be mapped to a specific HSM subrole. These subroles can then be used as the targets of Ansible plays run by CFS to configure these nodes. The component name (xname) for each application node can be assigned one or more hostname aliases.\nSee Create Application Node YAML for instructions about creating this file.\nhmn_connections.json The hmn_connections.json file is extracted from the HMN tab of the SHCD spreadsheet. The CSM release includes the hms-shcd-parser container; this container can do the extraction on the PIT node booted from the LiveCD (RemoteISO or USB device) or on a Linux system. Although some information in these files can be populated from site survey information, the SHCD prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing is the best source of data for hmn_connections.json.\nNo action is required to create this file at this point, and will be created when the PIT node is bootstrapped.\nncn_metadata.csv The information in the ncn_metadata.csv file identifies each of the management nodes, assigns the function as a master, worker, or storage node, and provides the MAC address information needed to identify the BMC and the NIC which will be used to boot the node.\nFor each management node, the component name (xname), role, and subrole can be extracted from the SHCD. However, the rest of the MAC address information needs to be collected another way. Collect as much information as possible before the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD and then get the rest later when directed. See the scenarios which enable partial data collection in First Time Install.\nSee Create NCN Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\nswitch_metadata.csv The switch_metadata.csv file is manually created to include information about all spine, aggregation, CDU, and leaf switches in the system. None of the Slingshot switches for the HSN should be included in this file.\nSee Create Switch Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\n9. site-init customizations Several settings will be added to the customizations.yaml file in the site-init directory after csi config init has been run. Here is the additional information needed at that time.\nFor explanation of the names and sample settings see Prepare Site Init.\n   Name Value     spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_reds_credentials Username    spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_reds_credentials Password    spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_meds_credentials Username    spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_meds_credentials Password    spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_hms_rts_credentials Username    spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_hms_rts_credentials Password        PKI Certificate Authority (CA) Value     root_days    int_days    root_cn    int_cn    Is a site (external) CA available?    Is a site (external) CA private key available?    Is a site (external) CA certificate available?      Note: Outside of a new installation of the CSM software, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. Ensure that validity periods are set accordingly for external CAs used in this process. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n    (Optional) LDAP Settings Value     Is a site LDAP server available?    First site LDAP server    First site LDAP server port    (Optional) Second site LDAP server    (Optional) Second site LDAP server port    (Optional) Third site LDAP server    (Optional) Third site LDAP server port    Site LDAP ldapSearchBase    Site LDAP localRoleAssignments      Note: Setting forwardZones is needed if the site LDAP server is specified via a hostname rather than an IP address. See Prepare Site Init\n 10. Application nodes Each application node can have specific information about it. Besides the CAN, some application nodes have additional network connections to Ethernet or InfiniBand.\nThe only predefined application node SHCD prefix and subrole is for UAN (User Access Node).\n   Each Application Node Value     BMC or iLO username    BMC or iLO password    SHCD prefix    subrole    Hostname alias or aliases    Is CAN enabled for this node?    CAN IP address    CAN default route/gateway    CAN netmask    Network interface connected to CAN    Is network interface (net1) enabled for this node?    net1 bootproto    net1 device    net1 IP address    net1 startmode    net1 ifroute route or routes    net1 ifrule rules    Is network interface (net2) enabled for this node?    net2 bootproto    net2 device    net2 IP address    net2 startmode    net2 ifroute route or routes    net2 ifrule rules     Common settings for all User Access Nodes (UANs). These could be set the same for all application nodes rather than being set only for UANs.\n   Common UAN settings Value     UAN global route or routes    UAN external DNS searchlist    UAN first external DNS server    UAN second external DNS server    UAN third external DNS server    UAN external DNS options    UAN LDAP enabled for login?    UAN LDAP domain    UAN LDAP search_base    UAN LDAP server or servers    UAN LDAP chpass_uri    UAN AD groups    UAN PAM modules     11. Filesystems For clients of a filesystem, there is some common data needed to be able to mount it. The filesystem type (fstype) could be Lustre, SpectrumScale (GPFS), or NFS.\n   Each Filesystem Value     Filesystem name    Source IP address    fstype    Mount point    Mount options     "

The v1 HSM APIs will be removed in the CSM version 1.3 release. Many CAPMC v1 REST API and CLI features are being deprecated as part of CSM version 1.0.1; Full removal of the deprecated CAPMC features will happen in CSM version 1.3. Further development of CAPMC service or CLI has stopped. CAPMC has entered end-of-life but will still be generally available. CAPMC is going to be replaced with the Power Control Service (PCS) in a future release. The current API/CLI portfolio for CAPMC is being pruned to better align with the future direction of PCS. More information about PCS and the CAPMC transition will be released as part of subsequent CSM releases.  For more information on what features have been deprecated, see the CAPMC deprecation notice.   HMNFD v1 REST API will be deprecated in CSM version 1.2. The v1 HMNFD APIs will be removed in the CSM version 1.5 release. The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) API will change in the CSM V1.2.0 release:  The --template-body option for the Cray CLI bos command will be deprecated. Prior to CSM V1.2.0, performing a successful GET on the session status for a boot set (i.e. /v1/session/{session_id}/status/{boot_set_name}) incorrectly returns a status code of 201. In CSM V1.2.0 it will correctly return a status code of 200.   The Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) will be deprecated in CSM 1.2.0 and will be removed in a future CSM release. Enhanced BOS functionality will replace CRUS.  Removed features The following features have been completely removed:\n cray-conman pod. This has been replaced by cray-console-node. The csi config init command has changed the option from -ntp-pool to ntp-pools to support a comma-separated list of NTP pools. CFS v1 API and CLI will be removed in CSM 1.2.0. The v2 API and CLI have been the default since CSM 0.9 (Shasta 1.4).  Other changes "

	"content": "Documentation Conventions Several conventions have been used in the preparation of this documentation.\n Markdown Format File Formats Typographic Conventions Command Prompt Conventions which describe the context for user, host, directory, chroot environment, or container environment  Markdown Format This documentation is in Markdown format. Although much of it can be viewed with any text editor, a richer experience will come from using a tool which can render the Markdown to show different font sizes, the use of bold and italics formatting, inclusion of diagrams and screen shots as image files, and to follow navigational links within a topic file and to other files.\nThere are many tools which can render the Markdown format to get these advantages. Any Internet search for Markdown tools will provide a long list of these tools. Some of the tools are better than others at displaying the images and allowing you to follow the navigational links.\nFile Formats Some of the installation instructions require updating files in JSON, YAML, or TOML format. These files should be updated with care because some file formats do not accept tab characters for indentation of lines. Only space characters are supported. Refer to online documentation to learn more about the syntax of JSON, YAML, and TOML files.\nTypographic Conventions This style indicates program code, reserved words, library functions, command-line prompts, screen output, file/path names, and other software constructs.\n\\ (backslash) At the end of a command line, indicates the Linux shell line continuation character (lines joined by a backslash are parsed as a single line).\nCommand Prompt Conventions Host name and account in command prompts The host name in a command prompt indicates where the command must be run. The account that must run the command is also indicated in the prompt.\n The root or super-user account always has the # character at the end of the prompt Any non-root account is indicated with account@hostname. A non-privileged account is referred to as user.  Node abbreviations The following list contains abbreviations for nodes used below\n CN - compute Node NCN - Non-Compute Node AN - Application Node (special type of NCN) UAN - User Access Node (special type of AN) PIT - Pre-Install Toolkit (initial node used as the inception node during software installation booted from the LiveCD)     Prompt Description     ncn# Run the command as root on any NCN, except an NCN which is functioning as an Application Node (AN), such as a UAN.   ncn-m# Run the command as root on any NCN-M (NCN which is a Kubernetes master node).   ncn-m002# Run the command as root on the specific NCN-M (NCN which is a Kubernetes master node) which has this hostname (ncn-m002).   ncn-w# Run the command as root on any NCN-W (NCN which is a Kubernetes worker node).   ncn-w001# Run the command as root on the specific NCN-W (NCN which is a Kubernetes master node) which has this hostname (ncn-w001).   ncn-s# Run the command as root on any NCN-S (NCN which is a Utility Storage node).   ncn-s003# Run the command as root on the specific NCN-S (NCN which is a Utility Storage node) which has this hostname (ncn-s003).   pit# Run the command as root on the PIT node.   linux# Run the command as root on a Linux host.   uan# Run the command as root on any UAN.   uan01# Run the command as root on hostname uan01.   user@uan\u0026gt; Run the command as any non-root user on any UAN.   cn# Run the command as root on any CN. Note that a CN will have a hostname of the form nid124356, that is \u0026ldquo;nid\u0026rdquo; and a six digit, zero padded number.   hostname# Run the command as root on the specified hostname.   user@hostname\u0026gt; Run the command as any non-root user son the specified hostname.    Command prompt inside chroot If the chroot command is used, the prompt changes to indicate that it is inside a chroot environment on the system.\nhostname# chroot /path/to/chroot chroot-hostname# Command prompt inside Kubernetes pod If executing a shell inside a container of a Kubernetes pod where the pod name is $podName, the prompt changes to indicate that it is inside the pod. Not all shells are available within every pod, this is an example using a commonly available shell.\nncn# kubectl exec -it $podName /bin/sh pod# Command prompt inside image customization session If using SSH during an image customization session, the prompt changes to indicate that it is inside the image customization environment (pod). This example uses $PORT and $HOST as environment variables with specific settings. When using chroot in this context the prompt will be different than the above chroot example.\nhostname# ssh -p $PORT root@$HOST root@POD# chroot /mnt/image/image-root :/# Directory path in command prompt Example prompts do not include the directory path, because long paths can reduce the clarity of examples. Most of the time, the command can be executed from any directory. When it matters which directory the command is invoked within, the cd command is used to change into the directory, and the directory is referenced with a period (.) to indicate the current directory\nExamples of prompts as they appear on the system:\nhostname:~ # cd /etc hostname:/etc# cd /var/tmp hostname:/var/tmp# ls ./file hostname:/var/tmp# su - user user@hostname:~\u0026gt; cd /usr/bin user hostname:/usr/bin\u0026gt; ./command Examples of prompts as they appear in this publication:\nhostname # cd /etc hostname # cd /var/tmp hostname # ls ./file hostname # su - user user@hostname \u0026gt; cd /usr/bin user@hostname \u0026gt; ./command Command prompts for network switch configuration The prompts when doing network switch configuration can vary widely depending on which vendor switch is being configured and the context of the item being configured on that switch. There may be two levels of user privilege which have different commands available and a special command to enter configuration mode.\nExample of prompts as they appear in this publication:\nEnter \u0026ldquo;setup\u0026rdquo; mode for the switch make and model, for example:\nremote# ssh admin@sw-leaf-001 sw-leaf-001\u0026gt; enable sw-leaf-001# configure terminal sw-leaf-001(conf)# Refer to the switch vendor OEM documentation for more information about configuring a specific switch.\n"

	"content": "CSM Overview This CSM Overview describes the Cray System Management ecosystem with the hardware, software, network, and access to these services and components.\nThe CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage. These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.\nSystem services on these nodes are provided as containerized micro-services packaged for deployment as helm charts. These services are orchestrated by Kubernetes to be scheduled on Kubernetes worker nodes with horizontal scaling to increase or decrease the number of instances of some services as demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.\nTopics:  System Nodes and Networks Default IP Address Ranges Resilience of System Management Services Access to System Management Services  Details 1. System Nodes and Networks The HPE Cray EX system has two types of nodes:\n Compute Nodes, where high performance computing applications are run, have hostnames in the form of nidXXXXXX, that is, \u0026ldquo;nid\u0026rdquo; followed by six digits. These six digits will be padded with zeroes at the beginning. All other nodes provide supporting functions to these compute nodes. Non-Compute Nodes (NCNs), which carry out system functions and come in many types:  Management nodes in a Kubernetes cluster which host system services.  Kubernetes master nodes, with names in the form of ncn-mXXX. Every system has three or more master nodes. Kubernetes worker nodes, with names in the form of ncn-wXXX. Every system has three or more worker nodes. Utility Storage nodes providing Ceph storage to Kubernetes nodes, with names in the form of ncn-sXXX. Every system has three or more storage nodes.   Application nodes (ANs) which are not part of the Kubernetes management cluster  User Access Nodes (UANs), known by some as login or front-end nodes Other site-defined types:  Gateway nodes Data Mover nodes Visualization nodes        The following system networks connect the devices listed:\n Networks external to the system:  Customer Network (Data Center)  ncn-m001 BMC is connected by the customer network switch to the customer management network ClusterStor System Management Unit (SMU) interfaces User Access Nodes (UANs)     System networks:  Hardware Management Network (HMN)  BMCs for Admin tasks Power distribution units (PDU) Keyboard/video/mouse (KVM)   Node Management Network (NMN)  All NCNs and compute nodes   ClusterStor Management Network  ClusterStor controller management interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, Metadata Management Unit (MMU), and Scalable Storage Unit (SSU))   High-Speed Network (HSN), which connects the following devices:  Kubernetes worker nodes UANs ClusterStor controller data interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, MMU, and SSU)      During initial installation, several of those networks are created with default IP address ranges. See Default IP Address Ranges\nThe network management system (NMS) data model and REST API enable customer sites to construct their own \u0026ldquo;networks\u0026rdquo; of nodes within the high-speed fabric, where a \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo; is a collection of nodes that share a VLAN and an IP subnet.\nThe low-level network management components (switch, DHCP service, ARP service) of the management nodes and ClusterStor interfaces are configured to serve one particular network (the \u0026ldquo;supported network\u0026rdquo;) on the high-speed fabric. As part of the initial installation, the supported network is created to include all of the compute nodes, thereby enabling those compute nodes to access the gateway, user access services, and ClusterStor devices.\nA site may create other networks as well, but it is only the supported network that is served by those devices.\n2. Default IP Address Ranges The initial installation of the system creates default networks with default settings and with no external exposure. These IP address default ranges ensure that no nodes in the system attempt to use the same IP address as a Kubernetes service or pod, which would result in undefined behavior that is extremely difficult to reproduce or debug.\nThe following table shows the default IP address ranges\n   Network IP Address Range     Kubernetes service network 10.16.0.0/12   Kubernetes pod network 10.32.0.0/12   Install Network (MTL) 10.1.0.0/16   Node Management Network (NMN) 10.252.0.0/17   High Speed Network (HSN) 10.253.0.0/16   Hardware Management Network (HMN) 10.254.0.0/17    Mountain NMN Allocate a /22 from this range per liquid cooled cabinet: * cabinet 1 * cabinet 2 * cabinet 3 * \u0026hellip; 10.100.0.0/17 Example IP address in the allocated ranges: * 10.100.0.0/22 * 10.100.4.0/22 * 10.100.8.0/22 * \u0026hellip;   Mountain HMN Allocate a /22 from this range per liquid cooled cabinet: * cabinet 1 * cabinet 2 * cabinet 3 * \u0026hellip; 10.104.0.0/17 Example IP address in the allocated ranges: * 10.104.0.0/22 * 10.104.4.0/22 * 10.104.8.0/22 * \u0026hellip;   River NMN 10.106.0.0/17   River HMN 10.107.0.0/17   Load Balanced NMN     The above values could be modified prior to install if there is a need to ensure that there are no conflicts with customer resources, such as LDAP or license servers. If a customer has more than one HPE Cray EX system, these values can be safely reused across them all. Contact customer support for this site if it is required to change the IP address range for Kubernetes services or pods; for example, if the IP addresses within those ranges must be used for something else. The cluster must be fully reinstalled if either of those ranges are changed.\nThere are several network values and other pieces of system information that are unique to the customer system.\n  IP addresses and the network(s) for ncn-m001 and the BMC on ncn-m001.\n  The main Customer Access Network (CAN) subnet and the two address pools mentioned below need to be part of the main subnet.\nFor more information on the CAN, see Customer Access Network (CAN).\n Subnet for the MetalLB static address pool (can-static-pool), which is used for services that need to be pinned to the same IP address, such as the system DNS service. Subnet for the MetalLB dynamic address pool (can-dynamic-pool), which is used for services such as User Access Instances (UAIs) that can be reached by DNS.    HPE Cray EX Domain: The value of the subdomain that is used to access externally exposed services. For example, if the system is named TestSystem, and the site is example.com, the HPE Cray EX domain would be testsystem.example.com. Central DNS would need to be configured to delegate requests for addresses in this domain to the HPE Cray EX DNS IP address for resolution.\n  HPE Cray EX DNS IP: The IP address used for the HPE Cray EX DNS service. Central DNS delegates the resolution for addresses in the HPE Cray EX Domain to this server. The IP address will be in the can-static-pool subnet.\n  CAN gateway IP address: The IP address assigned to a specific port on the spine switch, which will act as the gateway between the CAN and the rest of the customer\u0026rsquo;s internal networks. This address would be the lasthop route to the CAN network.\n  3. Resilience of System Management Services HPE Cray EX systems are designed so that system management services (SMS) are fully resilient and that there is no single point of failure. The design of the system allows for resiliency in the following ways:\n Three management nodes are configured as Kubernetes master nodes. When one master goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three utility storage nodes provide persistent storage for the services running on the Kubernetes management nodes. When one of the utility storage nodes goes down, operations (such as jobs running across compute nodes) are expected to continue. At least three management nodes are configured as Kubernetes worker nodes. If one of only three Kubernetes worker nodes were to go down, it would be much more difficult for the remaining two worker nodes to handle the total balance of pods. It is less significant to lose one of the worker nodes if the system has more than three worker nodes because there are more worker nodes able to handle the pod load. The state and configuration of the Kubernetes cluster are stored in an etcd cluster distributed across the Kubernetes master nodes. This cluster is also backed up on an interval, and backups are pushed to Ceph Rados Gateway (S3). A micro-service can run on any node that meets the requirements for that micro-service, such as appropriate hardware attributes, which are indicated by Kubernetes labels and taints. All micro-services have shared persistent storage so that they can be restarted on any worker node in the Kubernetes management cluster without losing state.  Kubernetes is designed to ensure that the desired number of deployments of a micro-service are always running on one or more worker nodes. In addition, it ensures that if one worker node becomes unresponsive, the micro-services that were running on it are migrated to another worker node that is up and meets the requirements of those micro-services.\nFor more information about resiliency topics see Resilience of System Management Services.\n4. Access to System Management Services The standard configuration for System Management Services (SMS) is the containerized REST micro-service with a public API. All of the micro-services provide an HTTP interface and are collectively exposed through a single gateway URL. The API gateway for the system is available at a well known URL based on the domain name of the system. It acts as a single HTTPS endpoint for terminating Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the configured certificate authority. All services and the API gateway are not dependent on any single node. This resilient arrangement ensures that services remain available during possible underlying hardware and network failures.\nAccess to individual APIs through the gateway is controlled by a policy-driven access control system. Administrators and users must retrieve a token for authentication before attempting to access APIs through the gateway and present a valid token with each API call. The authentication and authorization decisions are made at the gateway level which prevent unauthorized API calls from reaching the underlying micro-services. For more detail on the process of obtaining tokens and user management, see System Security and Authentication.\nReview the API documentation in the supplied container before attempting to use the API services. This container is generated with the release using the most current API descriptions in OpenAPI 2.0 format. Because this file serves as both an internal definition of the API contract and the external documentation of the API function, it is the most up-to-date reference available.\nThe API Gateway URL for accessing the APIs on a site-specific system is https://api.SYSTEM-NAME.DOMAIN-NAME/apis/.\nThe internal URL from a local console on any of the management nodes is https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis.\n"

	"content": "Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe This section details how to migrate NCNs from using their onboard NICs for PXE booting to booting over the PCIe cards.\n Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe  Enabling UEFI PXE Mode  Mellanox  Print Current UEFI and SR-IOV State Setting Expected Values High-Speed Network  Obtaining Mellanox Tools     QLogic FastLinq  Kernel Modules     Disabling or Removing On-Board Connections    This applies to Newer systems (Spring 2020 or newer) where onboard NICs are still used.\nThis presents a need for migration for systems still using the legacy, preview topology. Specifically, systems with onboard connections to their leaf switches and NCNs need to disable/remove that connection.\nThis onboard NCN port came from before spine-switches were added to the shasta-network topology. The onboard connection was responsible for every network (MTL/NMN/HMN/CAN) and was the sole driver of PXE booting for. Now, NCNs use bond interfaces and spine switches for those networks; however, some older systems still have this legacy connection to their leaf switches and solely use it for PXE booting. This NIC is not used during runtime, and NCNs in this state should enable PXE within their PCIe devices' OpROMs and disable/remove this onboard connection.\nEnabling UEFI PXE Mode Mellanox The Mellanox CLI Tools are required to configure UEFI PXE from the Linux command line.\nOn any NCN (using 0.0.10 k8s, or 0.0.8 Ceph; anything built on ncn-0.0.21 or higher), run the following command to begin interacting with Mellanox cards:\n NOTE: If recovering NCNs with an earlier image without the Mellanox tools, refer to the Obtaining Mellanox Tools section.\n ncn# mst start Now mst status and other commands like mlxfwmanager or mlxconfig will work, and devices required for these commands will be created in /dev/mst.\nPrint Current UEFI and SR-IOV State  UEFI: All boots are UEFI; this needs to be enabled for access to the UEFI OpROM for configuration and for usage of UEFI firmwares. SR_IOV: This is currently DISABLED because it can attribute to longer POSTs on HPE blades (Gen10+, i.e. DL325 or DL385) with Mellanox ConnectX-5 PCIe cards. The technology is not yet enabled for virtualization usage, but may be in the future.\n Use the following snippet to display device name and current UEFI PXE state.\nncn# mst status for MST in $(ls /dev/mst/*); do mlxconfig -d ${MST} q | egrep \u0026#34;(Device|EXP_ROM|SRIOV_EN)\u0026#34; done Setting Expected Values Use the following snippet to enable and dump UEFI PXE state.\nfor MST in $(ls /dev/mst/*); do echo ${MST} mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_UEFI_x86_ENABLE=1 mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_PXE_ENABLE=1 mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set SRIOV_EN=0 mlxconfig -d ${MST} q | egrep \u0026#34;EXP_ROM\u0026#34; done High-Speed Network For worker nodes with High-Speed network attachments, the PXE and SR-IOV features should be disabled.\n  Run mlxfwmanager to probe and dump the Mellanox PCIe cards.\nncn# mlxfwmanager   Find the device path for the HSN card, assuming it is a ConnectX-5 or other 100GB card, this should be easy to pick out.\n  Run the following commands, swapping the MST variable for the actual card path.\n# Set UEFI to YES ncn# MST=/dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf1 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_UEFI_ARM_ENABLE=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_UEFI_x86_ENABLE=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set EXP_ROM_PXE_ENABLE=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} -y set SRIOV_EN=0 ncn# mlxconfig -d ${MST} q | egrep \u0026#34;EXP_ROM\u0026#34;   The Mellanox HSN card is now neutralized, and will only be usable in a booted system.\nObtaining Mellanox Tools For 1.4 or later systems, mft is installed in NCN images by default.\nFor 1.3 systems, obtain the Mellanox tools with the following commands:\nlinux# wget https://www.mellanox.com/downloads/MFT/mft-4.15.1-9-x86_64-rpm.tgz linux# tar -xzvf mft-4.15.1-9-x86_64-rpm.tgz linux# cd mft-4.15.1-9-x86_64-rpm/RPMS linux# rpm -ivh ./mft-4.15.1-9.x86_64.rpm linux# cd linux# mst start QLogic FastLinq These should already be configured for PXE booting.\nKernel Modules KMP modules for Qlogic are installed:\n qlgc-fastlinq-kmp-default qlgc-qla2xxx-kmp-default  Disabling or Removing On-Board Connections The onboard connection can be disabled in a few ways; short of removing the physical connection, one may shutdown the switchport as well.\nIf the physical connection can be removed, this is preferred and can be done so after enabling PXE on the PCIe cards.\nIf the connection must be disabled, log in to the respective leaf switch.\n  Connect to the leaf switch using serial or SSH connections.\nSelect one of the connection options below. The IP addresses and device names may vary in the commands below.\n# SSH over METAL MANAGEMENT pit# ssh admin@10.1.0.4 # SSH over NODE MANAGEMENT pit# ssh admin@10.252.0.4 # SSH over HARDWARE MANAGEMENT pit# ssh admin@10.254.0.4 # or.. serial (device name will vary). pit# minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/tty.USB1   Enter configuration mode.\nsw-leaf-001\u0026gt; configure terminal sw-leaf-001(config)#\u0026gt;   Disable the NCN interfaces.\nCheck the SHCD for reference before continuing so that the interfaces connected to management NCNs are being changed. Ports 2 to 10 are commonly the master, worker, and storage nodes when there are 3 of each. Some systems may have more worker nodes or utility storage nodes, or may be racked and cabled differently.\nsw-leaf-001(config)#\u0026gt; interface range 1/1/2-1/1/10 sw-leaf-001(config)#\u0026gt; shutdown sw-leaf-001(config)#\u0026gt; write memory Enable the interfaces again at anytime by switching the shutdown command out for no shutdown.\n  "

	"content": "Validate Management Network Cabling This page is designed to be a guide on how all nodes in a Shasta system are wired to the management network.\nThe Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) for this system describes how the cables connect the nodes to the management network switches and the connections between the different types of management network switches. Having SHCD data which matches how the physical system is cabled will be needed later when preparing the hmn_connections.json file from the SHCD as part of Prepare Configuration Payload procedure and later when doing the Configure Management Network Switches procedure.\n Open the SHCD Look at the Device Diagrams Tab.  There you will see what type of hardware is on the system. Take note of the hardware.   Look at the 25G_10G or 40G_10G tab, this will depend on the SHCD.   Look at this part of the page. The source is either a node or a switch. The destination is usually a switch. The source label info and destination label info indicate the component name (xname) and the port on that component to which the cable is connected. For example, x3000u01s1-j1, means the device in cabinet x3000 at location u01 within the cabinet and in slot s1 with port j1. The physical cable connecting source to destination should be labelled with source label info and destination label info.\nSee Component Names (xnames).\n   Source Source Label Info Destination Label Info Destination     mn01 x3000u01s1-j1 x3000u24L-j1 sw-25g01   mn01 x3000u01s1-j2 x3000u24R-j1 sw-25g02   mn02 x3000u03s1-j1 x3000u24L-j2 sw-25g01   mn02 x3000u03s1-j2 x3000u24R-j2 sw-25g02   mn03 x3000u05s1-j1 x3000u24L-j3 sw-25g01   mn03 x3000u05s1-j2 x3000u24R-j3 sw-25g02   wn01 x3000u07s1-j1 x3000u24L-j4 sw-25g01   wn01 x3000u07s1-j2 x3000u24R-j4 sw-25g02   wn02 x3000u09s1-j1 x3000u24L-j5 sw-25g01   wn02 x3000u09s1-j2 x3000u24R-j5 sw-25g02   wn03 x3000u011s1-j1 x3000u24L-j6 sw-25g01   wn03 x3000u011s1-j2 x3000u24R-j6 sw-25g02   sn01 x3000u013s1-j1 x3000u24L-j7 sw-25g01   sn01 x3000u013s1-j2 x3000u24R-j7 sw-25g02   sn02 x3000u015s1-j1 x3000u24L-j8 sw-25g01   sn02 x3000u015s1-j2 x3000u24R-j8 sw-25g02   sn03 x3000u017s1-j1 x3000u24L-j9 sw-25g01   sn03 x3000u017s1-j2 x3000u24R-j9 sw-25g02   uan01 x3000u027s1-j1 x3000u24L-j10 sw-25g01   uan01 x3000u027s1-j2 x3000u24R-j10 sw-25g02   uan02 x3000u029s1-j1 x3000u24L-j13 sw-25g01   uan02 x3000u029s1-j2 x3000u24R-j13 sw-25g02   uan03 x3000u031s1-j1 x3000u24L-j14 sw-25g01   uan03 x3000u031s1-j2 x3000u24R-j14 sw-25g02      Based on the vendor of the nodes and the name in the first column we can determine how it is supposed to be cabled.\n  We can use mn01 as an example.

Both of those can use this procedure. The only difference in this procedure is that the RemoteISO method will execute these commands on the PIT node with command prompt pit# while the USB method could be done on any Linux system with the command prompt linux#. This procedure works for both methods, but has the command prompt of linux#, even though it would normally be pit# for the RemoteISO method.\nTopics  Background Create and Initialize Site Init Directory Create Baseline System Customizations Generate Sealed Secrets Version Control Site Init Files  Push to a Remote Repository   Patch cloud-init with the CA Customer-Specific Customizations  Details 1.

This sealed secret contains the following:\n Default Redfish root user credentials for air-cooled Node and Router BMCs. Default SNMP credentials configured on leaf-bmc switches. This needs to match the SNMP credentials currently configured on leaf-bmc switches or the credentials will be configured later in the install. The SNMP username, authentication password, and the privacy password need to be provided.  The cray_meds_credentials are used by the Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) for the liquid-cooled components in an Olympus (Mountain) cabinet.\n The root user password needs to match what is currently configured on the CECs for the liquid-cooled cabinets in the system.  The cray_hms_rts_credentials are used by the Redfish Translation Service (RTS) for any hardware components which are not managed by Redfish, such as a ServerTech PDU in a River Cabinet.\n The ServerTech PDU credentials need to match the credentials for the admn user that is currently configured on the PDUs. The RTS root user credentials are unique to RTS and used only within the service mesh; these can be set as desired.  Edit customizations.yaml to replace the Username and Password references in the file so that the values match the existing settings of your system hardware components. See the Decrypt Sealed Secrets for Review section of Manage Sealed Secrets if needing to examine credentials from prior installs.\n  Review the changes that you made:\nlinux# diff /mnt/pitdata/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml /mnt/pitdata/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml.prepassword   Validate that REDS/MEDS/RTS sealed secrets contain valid JSON using jq:\nValidate REDS credentials (used by the REDS and HMS discovery services, targeting River Redfish BMC endpoints and management switches).\nlinux# yq read /mnt/pitdata/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml \u0026#39;spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_reds_credentials.generate.data[0].args.value\u0026#39; | jq linux# yq read /mnt/pitdata/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml \u0026#39;spec.kubernetes.sealed_secrets.cray_reds_credentials.generate.data[1].args.value\u0026#39; | jq  NOTE: For vault_redfish_defaults, the only entry used is '{\u0026quot;Cray\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;Username\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;root\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Password\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;XXXX\u0026quot;}' Make sure it is specified as shown, with the Cray key.

The password for the JKS file must be password. Administrators may use the keytool command from the openjdk:11-jre-slim container image packaged with CSM to create a JKS file that includes a PEM-encoded CA certificate to verify the LDAP host(s) as follows:\nThis step builds an example that will create (or update) cert.jks with the PEM-encoded CA certificate for an LDAP host and then prepares certs.jks.b64 which will be injected into customizations.yaml.\n  Load the openjdk container image:\n NOTE Requires a properly configured Docker or Podman environment.\nIf this step fails with an \u0026ldquo;overlay is not supported\u0026rdquo; error, run the following command and then re-run the load-container-image.sh script:\nsed -i 's/skopeo_dest=.*/skopeo_dest=\u0026quot;${transport}:${image}\u0026quot;/' /mnt/pitdata/${CSM_RELEASE}/hack/load-container-image.sh\n linux# /mnt/pitdata/${CSM_RELEASE}/hack/load-container-image.sh dtr.dev.cray.com/library/openjdk:11-jre-slim   Get the issuer certificate for the LDAP server at port 636. Use openssl s_client to connect and show the certificate chain returned by the LDAP host:\nlinux# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $LDAP:${PORT} \u0026lt;/dev/null   Either manually extract (i.e., cut/paste) the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate into cacert.pem or try the following commands to create it automatically.\n NOTE The following commands were verified using OpenSSL version 1.1.1d and use the -nameopt RFC2253 option to ensure consistent formatting of distinguished names (DNs). Unfortunately, older versions of OpenSSL may not support -nameopt on the s_client command or may use a different default format. As a result, your mileage may vary; however, you should be able to extract the issuer certificate manually from the output of the above openssl s_client example if the following commands are unsuccessful.\n   Observe the issuer\u0026rsquo;s DN:\nlinux# openssl s_client -showcerts -nameopt RFC2253 -connect $LDAP:${PORT} \u0026lt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | grep issuer= | sed -e \u0026#39;s/^issuer=//\u0026#39; Expected output would include a line similar to this:\nemailAddress=dcops@hpe.com,CN=Data Center,OU=HPC/MCS,O=HPE,ST=WI,C=US   Extract the issuer\u0026rsquo;s certificate using awk:\n NOTE The issuer DN is properly escaped as part of the awk pattern below. It must be changed to match the value for emailAddress, CN, OU, etc. for your LDAP.

(Optional) WARNING If production system or operational security is a concern, do NOT store the sealed secret private key in Git; instead, store the sealed secret key outside of Git in a secure offline system. To ensure these sensitive keys are not accidentally committed, configure .gitignore to ignore files under the certs directory:\nlinux# echo \u0026#34;certs/\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .gitignore   Stage site-init files to be committed:\nlinux# git add -A   Review what will be committed:\nlinux# git status   Commit all the above changes as the baseline configuration:\nlinux# git commit -m \u0026#34;Baseline configuration for $(/mnt/pitdata/${CSM_RELEASE}/lib/version.sh)\u0026#34;   5.1 Push to a Remote Repository It is strongly recommended that the site-init repository be maintained off-cluster. Add a remote repository and push the baseline configuration on master branch to a corresponding remote branch.\n6. Patch cloud-init with the CA NOTE Only execute this procedure if you booted from the remote ISO using procedure Bootstrap LiveCD Remote ISO). Skip this if using a USB LiveCD. These steps are done elsewhere in that procedure.\nUsing csi on a generated site-init directory:\n  Patch the CA certificate from the shasta-cfg:\npit# csi patch ca \\ --cloud-init-seed-file /var/www/ephemeral/configs/data.json \\ --customizations-file /var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml \\ --sealed-secret-key-file /var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/certs/sealed_secrets.key   Ensure that it picks up the new metadata:\npit# systemctl restart basecamp   Unmount the shim from earlier, if one was used.\npit# umount -v /mnt/pitdata   7. Customer-Specific Customizations Customer-specific customizations are any changes on top of the baseline configuration to satisfy customer-specific requirements. It is recommended that customer-specific customizations be tracked on branches separate from the mainline in order to make them easier to manage.\nApply any customer-specific customizations by merging the corresponding branches into master branch of /mnt/pitdata/prep/site-init.\nWhen considering merges, and especially when resolving conflicts, carefully examine differences to ensure all changes are relevant. For example, when applying a customer-specific customization used in a prior version, be sure the change still makes sense. It is common for options to change as new features are introduced and bugs are fixed.\n"

	"content": "Redeploy PIT Node The following procedure contains information for rebooting and deploying the management node that is currently hosting the LiveCD. At the end of this procedure, the LiveCD will no longer be active. The node it was using will join the Kubernetes cluster as the final of three master nodes, forming a quorum.\nIMPORTANT: While the node is rebooting, it will only be available through Serial-Over-LAN (SOL) and local terminals. This procedure entails deactivating the LiveCD, meaning the LiveCD and all of its resources will be unavailable.\n Required services Notice of danger Hand-off Reboot Enable NCN disk wiping safeguard Fix NTP on ncn-m001 Remove the default NTP pool Configure DNS and NTP on each BMC Validate BOOTRAID artifacts Next topic  1. Required services These services must be healthy before the reboot of the LiveCD can take place. If the health checks performed earlier in the install completed successfully (Validate CSM Health), then the following platform services will be healthy and ready for reboot of the LiveCD:\n Utility Storage (Ceph) cray-bss cray-dhcp-kea cray-dns-unbound cray-ipxe cray-sls cray-tftp  2. Notice of danger  An administrator is strongly encouraged to be mindful of pitfalls during this segment of the CSM install. The steps below do contain warnings themselves, but overall there are risks:\n SSH will cease to work when the LiveCD reboots; the serial console will need to be used. Rebooting a remote ISO will dump all running changes on the PIT node; USB devices are accessible after the install. The NCN will never wipe a USB device during installation. Prior to shutting down the PIT node, learning the CMN IP addresses of the other NCNs will be helpful if troubleshooting is required.  This procedure entails deactivating the LiveCD, meaning the LiveCD and all of its resources will be unavailable.\n 3. Hand-off The steps in this section load hand-off data before a later procedure reboots the LiveCD node.\n\n  Start a new typescript.\n  Exit the current typescript, if one is active.\npit# exit   Start a new typescript on the PIT node.\npit# mkdir -pv /var/www/ephemeral/prep/admin \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pushd /var/www/ephemeral/prep/admin \u0026amp;\u0026amp; script -af csm-livecd-reboot.$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt pit# export PS1=\u0026#39;\\u@\\H \\D{%Y-%m-%d} \\t \\w # \u0026#39;     Follow the workaround instructions for the livecd-pre-reboot breakpoint.\n  Upload SLS file.\n NOTE: The environment variable SYSTEM_NAME must be set.\n pit# csi upload-sls-file --sls-file /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${SYSTEM_NAME}/sls_input_file.json Expected output looks similar to the following:\n2021/02/02 14:05:15 Retrieving S3 credentials ( sls-s3-credentials ) for SLS 2021/02/02 14:05:15 Uploading SLS file: /var/www/ephemeral/prep/eniac/sls_input_file.json 2021/02/02 14:05:15 Successfully uploaded SLS Input File.

The most common procedures that involve customizing the images are Configuring NCN Images to Use Local Timezone and Changing NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys on PIT Node. The two paths forward are listed below:\n  If the NCN images were customized, set the following variables:\npit# artdir=/var/www/ephemeral/data pit# k8sdir=$artdir/k8s pit# cephdir=$artdir/ceph   If the NCN images were not customized, set the following variables:\npit# CSM_RELEASE=csm-x.y.z pit# artdir=/var/www/ephemeral/${CSM_RELEASE}/images pit# k8sdir=$artdir/kubernetes pit# cephdir=$artdir/storage-ceph     After setting the variables in the previous step, run the following command.\npit# csi handoff ncn-images \\  --k8s-kernel-path $k8sdir/*.kernel \\  --k8s-initrd-path $k8sdir/initrd.img*.xz \\  --k8s-squashfs-path $k8sdir/*.squashfs \\  --ceph-kernel-path $cephdir/*.kernel \\  --ceph-initrd-path $cephdir/initrd.img*.xz \\  --ceph-squashfs-path $cephdir/*.squashfs The end of the command output contains a block similar to this:\nRun the following commands so that the versions of the images that were just uploaded can be used in other steps: export KUBERNETES_VERSION=x.y.z export CEPH_VERSION=x.y.z   Run the export commands listed at the end of the output from the previous step.\n    Upload the data.json file to BSS, our cloud-init data source.\nIf any changes have been made to this file (for example, as a result of any customizations or workarounds), then use the path to the modified file instead.\n This step will prompt for the root password of the NCNs.\n pit# csi handoff bss-metadata --data-file /var/www/ephemeral/configs/data.json || echo \u0026#34;ERROR: csi handoff bss-metadata failed\u0026#34;   Patch the metadata for the Ceph nodes to have the correct run commands.\npit# python3 /usr/share/doc/csm/scripts/patch-ceph-runcmd.py   Ensure that the DNS server value is correctly set to point toward Unbound at 10.92.100.225.\npit# csi handoff bss-update-cloud-init --set meta-data.dns-server=10.92.100.225 --limit Global   Preserve logs and configuration files if desired (optional).\nAfter the PIT node is redeployed, all files on its local drives will be lost. It is recommended to retain some of the log files and configuration files, because they may be useful if issues are encountered during the remainder of the install.\nThe following commands create a tar archive of these files, storing it in a directory that will be backed up in the next step.\npit# mkdir -pv /var/www/ephemeral/prep/logs \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ls -d \\  /etc/dnsmasq.d \\  /etc/os-release \\  /etc/sysconfig/network \\  /opt/cray/tests/cmsdev.log \\  /opt/cray/tests/install/logs \\  /opt/cray/tests/logs \\  /root/.canu \\  /root/.config/cray/logs \\  /root/csm*.{log,txt} \\  /tmp/*.log \\  /var/log/conman \\  /var/log/zypper.log 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | sed \u0026#39;s_^/__\u0026#39; | xargs tar -C / -czvf /var/www/ephemeral/prep/logs/pit-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).tgz   Upload the bootstrap information.\n NOTE: This preserves information that should always be kept together in order to fresh-install the system again.\n   Log in and set up passwordless SSH to the PIT node.\nCopying only the public keys from ncn-m002 and ncn-m003 to the PIT node.

This information is required by CSM to perform hardware discovery and geolocation of air-cooled hardware in the system. The HMN tab may contain other hardware that is not managed by CSM, but is connected to the HMN.\nThe hmn_connections.json file is derived from the HMN tab of a system SHCD, and is one of the seed files required by the Cray Site Init (CSI) tool to generate configuration files required to install CSM. The hmn_connections.json file is almost a one-to-one copy of the right-hand table in the HMN tab of the SHCD. It is an array of JSON objects, and each object represents a row from the HMN tab. Any row that is not understood by CSI will be ignored; this includes any additional devices connected to the HMN that are not managed by CSM.\nThe System Layout Service (SLS) contains data about what hardware is in the system and how it is connected to the HMN network. This data is generated when the CSI tool generates configurations files for system. For air-cooled hardware, SLS will contain the SLS representation of the device and a Management Switch Connector object that describes what device is plugged into a particular management switch port.\nColumn mapping from SHCD to hmn_connections.json:\n   SHCD Column SHCD Column Name hmn_connections Field Description     J20 Source Source Name of the device connected to the HMN network   K20 Rack SourceRack Source rack; matches regular expression x\\d+   L20 Location SourceLocation For nodes (management, compute, application), this is bottom rack slot that the node occupies, and can be extracted by [a-zA-Z]*(\\d+)([a-zA-Z]*). For other device types, this is ignored.   M20  SourceSubLocation For compute nodes, this can be L, l, R, r, or blank. For other device types, this is ignored.   N20 Parent SourceParent    O20  not used    P20 Port not used    Q20 Destination not used    R20 Rack DestinationRack Rack of the management switch   S20 Location DestinationLocation Rack slot of the management switch   T20  not used    U20 Port DestinationPort Switch port on the management switch     Only J20 needs to have the column name of Source. There are no requirements on what the other columns should be named.\n Some conventions for this document:\n All Source names from the SHCD are converted to lowercase before being processed by the CSI tool. Throughout this document, the field names from the hmn_connections.json file will be used to referenced values from the SHCD. Each device type has an example of how it is represented in the HMN tab of the SHCD, the hmn_connections.json file, and in SLS.  Compute node The Source field needs to match these conditions in order to be considered a compute node:\n  Has one of the following prefixes:\n nid cn    Ends with an integer that matches this regular expression: (\\d+$)\n This integer is the Node ID (NID) for the node Each node should have a unique NID value    For example, the following are valid Source field values for compute nodes:\n nid000001 cn1 cn-01  Depending on the type of compute node, additional rules may apply. Compute nodes in the follow sections will use the nid prefix.\nDense four node chassis - Gigabyte or Intel chassis  Apollo 2000 compute nodes are not currently supported by CSM.\n Air-cooled compute nodes are typically in a 2U chassis that contains four compute nodes. Each of the compute nodes in the chassis gets its own row in the HMN tab, plus a parent row.\n The value of the SourceParent field is used to group together the 4 nodes that are contained within the same chassis, and it is used to reference another row in the SHCD HMN tab. The referenced SourceParent row is used to determine the rack slot that the compute nodes occupy. The SourceParent row can be a Chassis Management Controller, which can be used to control devices underneath it. This device typically will have a connection to the HMN. A Gigabyte CMC is an example of a CMC. If a CMC is not connected to the HMN network, this will prevent CSM services from managing that device. The SourceParent row can be a virtual parent that is used to group the compute nodes together symbolically into a chassis. It does not need to not have a connection to the HMN.  The rack slot that a compute node occupies is determined by the rack slot of the SourceParent. The SourceLocation of the parent is the bottom unit number of the chassis. All four nodes in the same chassis receive a component name (xname) with the bottom unit number of the chassis.\nThe BMC ordinal for a node\u0026rsquo;s BMC is derived from the NID of the node by applying a modulo of four and then adding one. For example, a node with NID 17 will have a BMC ordinal of (17 modulo 4) + 1 == 1 + 1 == 2. Therefore a node with NID 17 in slot 10 in cabinet 3000 will have the component name (xname) of x3000s10b2n0.\nCompute: Four node chassis: SHCD Example: Four compute nodes in the same chassis with a CMC connected to the network. The compute node chassis is located in slot 17 of cabinet 3000, and the compute node BMCs are connected to ports 33-36 in the management leaf switch in slot 14 of cabinet 3000. Port 32 on the leaf switch is for the CMC in the chassis. Refer to Chassis Management Controller section for additional details.\n   Source Rack Location  Parent  Port Destination Rack Location  Port     nid000001 x3000 u17 R SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j36   nid000002 x3000 u18 R SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j35   nid000003 x3000 u18 L SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j34   nid000004 x3000 u17 L SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j33   SubRack-001-CMC x3000 u17   - cmc sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j32     Note: Source names like cn1 and cn-01 are equivalent to the value nid000001.\n Example: Four compute nodes in the same chassis without a CMC connected to the HMN network.\n   Source Rack Location  Parent  Port Destination Rack Location  Port     nid000001 x3000 u17 R SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j36   nid000002 x3000 u18 R SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j35   nid000003 x3000 u18 L SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j34   nid000004 x3000 u17 L SubRack-001-CMC - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j33   SubRack-001-CMC x3000 u17   -           Note: Source names like cn1 and cn-01 are equivalent to the value nid000001.\n Compute: Four node chassis: HMN connections Example Four compute nodes in the same chassis with the a CMC connected to the network.

	"content": "Create NCN Metadata CSV The information in the ncn_metadata.csv file identifies each of the management nodes, assigns the function as a master, worker, or storage node, and provides the MAC address information needed to identify the BMC and the NIC which will be used to boot the node.\nSome of the data in the ncn_metadata.csv can be found in the SHCD in the HMN tab. However, the hardest data to collect is the MAC addresses for the node\u0026rsquo;s BMC, the node\u0026rsquo;s bootable network interface, and the pair of network interfaces which will become the bonded interface bond0.\nTopics:  Introduction  LACP Bonding   PXE or BOOTSTRAP MAC Sample ncn_metadata.csv Collection of MAC Addresses  Details Introduction Each of the management nodes is represented as a row in the ncn_metadata.csv file.\nFor example:\nXname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s9b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:77:26,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,94:40:c9:5f:b6:92 For each management node, the component name (xname), role, and subrole can be extracted from the SHCD in the HMN tab. However, the rest of the MAC address information needs to be collected another way.\nCheck the description for component names while mapping names between the SHCD and the ncn_metadata.csv file. See Component Names (xnames).\nThere are two interesting parts to the NCN metadata file:\n The MAC of the BMC The MAC(s) of the shasta-network interface(s)  The \u0026ldquo;shasta-network interface\u0026rdquo; is the interfaces, one or more, that comprise the NCNs' LACP link-aggregation ports.\nLACP Bonding NCNs may have one or more bond interfaces, which may be comprised from one or more physical interfaces. The preferred default configuration is two physical network interfaces per bond. The number of bonds themselves depends on the system\u0026rsquo;s network topology.\nFor example, systems with four network interfaces on a given node could configure either of these permutations (for redundancy minimums within Shasta cluster):\n One bond with four interfaces (bond0) Two bonds with two interfaces each (bond0 and bond1)  For more information, see NCN Networking page for NCNs.\nPXE or BOOTSTRAP MAC In general this refers to the interface to be used when the node attempts to PXE boot. This varies between vintages of systems; systems before \u0026ldquo;Spring 2020\u0026rdquo; often booted NCNs with onboard NICs, newer systems boot over their PCIe cards.\nIf the system is booting over PCIe then the \u0026ldquo;bootstrap MAC\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;bond0 MAC0\u0026rdquo; will be identical. If the system is booting over onboard NICs then the \u0026ldquo;bootstrap MAC\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;bond0 MAC0\u0026rdquo; will be different.\n Other Nomenclature\n  \u0026ldquo;BOND MACS\u0026rdquo; are the MAC addresses for the physical interfaces that your node will use for the various VLANs. BOND0 MAC0 and BOND0 MAC1 should not be on the same physical network card to establish redundancy for failed chips. On the other hand, if any nodes' capacity prevents it from being redundant, then MAC1 and MAC0 will still produce a valid configuration if they do reside on the same physical chip/card. The BMC MAC is the exclusive, dedicated LAN for the onboard BMC. It should not be swapped with any other device.  Sample ncn_metadata.csv The following are sample rows from a ncn_metadata.csv file:\n  Use case: NCN with a single PCIe card (1 card with 2 ports):\n Notice how the MAC address for Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 are only off by 1, which indicates that they are on the same 2 port card.\n Xname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s6b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:37:77:b8,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:01   Use case: NCN with a dual PCIe cards (2 cards with 2 ports each for 4 ports total):\n Notice how the MAC address for Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 have a difference greater than 1, which indicates that they are on not on the same 2 port same card.\n Xname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s9b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:77:26,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,94:40:c9:5f:b6:92   Example ncn_metadata.csv file for a system that has been configured as follows:\n Management NCNs are configured to boot over the PCIe NICs Master and Storage management NCNs have two 2 port PCIe cards Worker management NCNs have one 2 port PCIe card   Because the NCNs have been configured to boot over their PCIe NICs, the Bootstrap MAC and Bond0 MAC0 columns have the same value.\n IMPORTANT: Mind the index for each group of nodes (3, 2, 1\u0026hellip;. ; not 1, 2, 3). If storage nodes are ncn-s001 x3000c0s7b0n0, ncn-s002 x3000c0s8b0n0, ncn-s003 x3000c0s9b0n0, then their portion of the file would be ordered x3000c0s9b0n0, x3000c0s8b0n0, x3000c0s7b0n0.\nXname,Role,Subrole,BMC MAC,Bootstrap MAC,Bond0 MAC0,Bond0 MAC1 x3000c0s9b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:77:26,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,14:02:ec:d9:76:88,94:40:c9:5f:b6:92 x3000c0s8b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:87:5a,14:02:ec:d9:7b:c8,14:02:ec:d9:7b:c8,94:40:c9:5f:b6:5c x3000c0s7b0n0,Management,Storage,94:40:c9:37:0a:2a,14:02:ec:d9:7c:88,14:02:ec:d9:7c:88,94:40:c9:5f:9a:a8 x3000c0s6b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:37:77:b8,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:00,14:02:ec:da:bb:01 x3000c0s5b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:35:03:06,14:02:ec:d9:76:b8,14:02:ec:d9:76:b8,14:02:ec:d9:76:b9 x3000c0s4b0n0,Management,Worker,94:40:c9:37:67:60,14:02:ec:d9:7c:40,14:02:ec:d9:7c:40,14:02:ec:d9:7c:41 x3000c0s3b0n0,Management,Master,94:40:c9:37:04:84,14:02:ec:d9:79:e8,14:02:ec:d9:79:e8,94:40:c9:5f:b5:cc x3000c0s2b0n0,Management,Master,94:40:c9:37:f9:b4,14:02:ec:da:b8:18,14:02:ec:da:b8:18,94:40:c9:5f:a3:a8 x3000c0s1b0n0,Management,Master,94:40:c9:37:87:32,14:02:ec:da:b9:98,14:02:ec:da:b9:98,14:02:ec:da:b9:99 Collection of MAC Addresses Collect as much information as possible for the ncn_metadata.csv file before the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD, and then get the rest later when directed. Having dummy MAC addresses, such as de:ad:be:ef:00:00, in the ncn_metadata.csv file is acceptable until the point during the install at which the management network switches have been configured and the PIT node can be used to collect the information. The correct MAC addresses are needed before attempting to boot the management nodes with their real image in Deploy Management Nodes.\n  If the nodes are booted to Linux, then the data can be collected by ipmitool lan print for the BMC MAC, and the ip address command for the other NICs. This is rarely the case for a first time install. The PIT node examples of using these two commands could be extrapolated for other nodes which are booted to Linux. See the PIT node examples in Collecting BMC MAC Addresses and Collecting NCN MAC Addresses.\n  If the nodes are powered up and there is SSH access to the spine and leaf switches, it is possible to collect information from the spine and leaf switches.\n The BMC MAC address can be collected from the switches using knowledge about the cabling of the HMN from the SHCD. See Collecting BMC MAC Addresses. The node MAC addresses cannot be collected until after the PIT node has booted from the LiveCD. At that point, a partial boot of the management nodes can be done to collect the remaining information from the conman console logs on the PIT node using the Procedure: iPXE Consoles    If the nodes are powered up and there is no SSH access to the spine and leaf switches, it is possible to connect to the spine and leaf switches using the method described in Connect to Switch over USB-Serial Cable.\n The BMC MAC address can be collected from the switches using knowledge about the cabling of the HMN from the SHCD. See Collecting BMC MAC Addresses. The node MAC addresses cannot be collected until after the PIT node has booted from the LiveCD. At that point, a partial boot of the management nodes can be done to collect the remaining information from the conman console logs on the PIT node using the Procedure: iPXE Consoles.    In all other cases, the full information needed for ncn_metadata.csv will not be available for collection until after the PIT node has been booted from the LiveCD. Having incorrect MAC addresses in the ncn_metadata.csv file as placeholders is acceptable until the point during the install at which the management network switches have been configured and the PIT node can be used to collect the information.\n At that point in the installation workflow, the Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs procedure will be used.    Unless the system does not use or does not have onboard NICs on the management nodes, then this topic may be necessary before constructing the ncn_metadata.csv file.\n See Switch PXE Boot from Onboard NIC to PCIe.

	"content": "Deploy Management Nodes The following procedure deploys Linux and Kubernetes software to the management NCNs. Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes followed by the master nodes and worker nodes together.\nAfter the operating system boots on each node, there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process completes for all nodes, the Ceph storage is initialized and the Kubernetes cluster is created and ready for a workload. The PIT node will join Kubernetes after it is rebooted later in Redeploy PIT Node.\nTiming of deployments The timing of each set of boots varies based on hardware. Nodes from some manufacturers will POST faster than others or vary based on BIOS setting. After powering a set of nodes on, an administrator can expect a healthy boot session to take about 60 minutes depending on the number of storage and worker nodes.\nTopics  Prepare for management node deployment  Tokens and IPMI password Apply NCN pre-boot workarounds Ensure time is accurate before deploying NCNs   Update management node firmware Deploy management nodes  Deploy workflow Deploy Check LVM on Kubernetes NCNs Check for unused drives on utility storage nodes Apply NCN post-boot workarounds   Configure after management node deployment  LiveCD cluster authentication BGP routing Install tests and test server on NCNs Remove the default NTP pool   Validate management node deployment  Validation Optional validation   Important checkpoint Next topic  1. Prepare for management node deployment Preparation of the environment must be done before attempting to deploy the management nodes.\n1.1 Tokens and IPMI password   Define shell environment variables that will simplify later commands to deploy management nodes.\n  Set IPMI_PASSWORD to the root password for the NCN BMCs.\n read -s is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.\n pit# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD pit# export IPMI_PASSWORD   Set the remaining helper variables.\n These values do not need to be altered from what is shown.\n pit# mtoken=\u0026#39;ncn-m(?!001)\\w+-mgmt\u0026#39; ; stoken=\u0026#39;ncn-s\\w+-mgmt\u0026#39; ; wtoken=\u0026#39;ncn-w\\w+-mgmt\u0026#39; ; export USERNAME=root   Throughout the guide, simple one-liners can be used to query status of expected nodes. If the shell or environment is terminated, these environment variables should be re-exported.\nExamples:\n  Check power status of all NCNs.\npit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power status   Power off all NCNs.\npit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power off     1.2 Apply NCN pre-boot workarounds There will be post-boot workarounds as well.\nFollow the workaround instructions for the before-ncn-boot breakpoint.\n1.3 Ensure time is accurate before deploying NCNs NOTE: Optionally, in order to use a timezone other than UTC, instead of step 1 below, follow this procedure for setting a local timezone. Then proceed to step 2.\n  Ensure that the PIT node has the correct current time.\nThe time can be inaccurate if the system has been powered off for a long time, or, for example, the CMOS was cleared on a Gigabyte node. See Clear Gigabyte CMOS.\n This step should not be skipped.\n Check the time on the PIT node to see whether it matches the current time:\npit# date \u0026#34;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N%z\u0026#34; If the time is inaccurate, set the time manually.\npit# timedatectl set-time \u0026#34;2019-11-15 00:00:00\u0026#34; Run the NTP script:\npit# /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh This ensures that the PIT is configured with an accurate date/time, which will be propagated to the NCNs during boot.\n  Ensure that the current time is set in BIOS for all management NCNs.\nEach NCN is booted to the BIOS menu, the date and time are checked, and set to the current UTC time if needed.\n NOTE: Some steps in this procedure depend on USERNAME and IPMI_PASSWORD being set. This is done in Tokens and IPMI Password.\n Repeat the following process for each NCN.\n  Set the bmc variable to the name of the BMC of the NCN being checked.\nImportant: Be sure to change the below example to the appropriate NCN.\npit# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt   Start an IPMI console session to the NCN.\npit# conman -j $bmc   Using another terminal to watch the console, boot the node to BIOS.\npit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis bootdev bios \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power off \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sleep 10 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power on  For HPE NCNs, the above process will boot the nodes to their BIOS; however, the BIOS menu is unavailable through conman because the node is booted into a graphical BIOS menu.\nIn order to access the serial version of the BIOS menu, perform the ipmitool steps above to boot the node. Then, in conman, press ESC+9 key combination when the following messages are shown on the console. That key combination will open a menu that can be used to enter the BIOS using conman.\nFor access via BIOS Serial Console: Press \u0026#39;ESC+9\u0026#39; for System Utilities Press \u0026#39;ESC+0\u0026#39; for Intelligent Provisioning Press \u0026#39;ESC+!\u0026#39; for One-Time Boot Menu Press \u0026#39;ESC+@\u0026#39; for Network Boot For HPE NCNs, the date configuration menu is at the following path: System Configuration -\u0026gt; BIOS/Platform Configuration (RBSU) -\u0026gt; Date and Time.\nAlternatively, for HPE NCNs, log in to the BMC\u0026rsquo;s web interface and access the HTML5 console for the node, in order to interact with the graphical BIOS. From the administrator\u0026rsquo;s own machine, create an SSH tunnel (-L creates the tunnel; -N prevents a shell and stubs the connection):\nlinux# bmc=ncn-w001-mgmt # Change this to be the appropriate node linux# ssh -L 9443:$bmc:443 -N root@eniac-ncn-m001 Opening a web browser to https://localhost:9443 will give access to the BMC\u0026rsquo;s web interface.\n   When the node boots, the conman session can be used to see the BIOS menu, in order to check and set the time to current UTC time. The process varies depending on the vendor of the NCN.\n  After the correct time has been verified, power off the NCN.\npit# ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H $bmc chassis power off   Repeat the above process for each NCN.\n  2. Update management node firmware  All firmware can be found in the HFP package provided with the Shasta release.\n The management nodes are expected to have certain minimum firmware installed for BMC, node BIOS, and PCIe cards. Where possible, the firmware should be updated prior to install. It is good to meet the minimum NCN firmware requirement before starting.\n Note: When the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD, it is not possible to use the Firmware Action Service (FAS) to update the the firmware because that service has not yet been installed. However, at this point, it would be possible to use the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product on the PIT node to learn about the firmware versions available in HFP.\n If the firmware is not updated at this point in the installation workflow, then it can be done with FAS after CSM and HFP have both been installed and configured. However, at that point a rolling reboot procedure for the management nodes will be needed, after the firmware has been updated.\nSee the Shasta 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center for information about the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product.\nIn the HFP documentation there is information about the recommended firmware packages to be installed. See \u0026ldquo;Product Details\u0026rdquo; in the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack Installation Guide.\nSome of the component types have manual procedures to check firmware versions and update firmware. See Upgrading Firmware Without FAS in the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack Installation Guide. It will be possible to extract the files from the product tarball, but the install.sh script from that product will be unable to load the firmware versions into the Firmware Action Services (FAS) because the management nodes are not booted and running Kubernetes and FAS cannot be used until Kubernetes is running.\nIf booted into the PIT node, the firmware can be found with HFP package provided with the Shasta release.\n  (optional) Check these BIOS settings on management nodes NCN BIOS.\n This is optional, the BIOS settings (or lack thereof) do not prevent deployment. The NCN installation will work with the CMOS' default BIOS. There may be settings that facilitate the speed of deployment, but they may be tuned at a later time.\nNOTE: The BIOS tuning will be automated, further reducing this step.\n   Check for minimum NCN firmware versions and update them as needed, The firmware on the management nodes should be checked for compliance with the minimum version required and updated, if necessary, at this point.\n WARNING: Gigabyte NCNs running BIOS version C20 can become unusable when Shasta 1.5 is installed. This is a result of a bug in the Gigabyte firmware. This bug has not been observed in BIOS version C17.\nA key symptom of this bug is that the NCN will not PXE boot and will instead fall through to the boot menu, despite being configure to PXE boot. This behavior will persist until the failing node\u0026rsquo;s CMOS is cleared.\n  See Clear Gigabyte CMOS.    3. Deploy management nodes Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes first, then the master nodes and worker nodes together. After the operating system boots on each node there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process is complete for all nodes, the Ceph storage will have been initialized and the Kubernetes cluster will be created ready for a workload.\n3.1 Deploy workflow The configuration workflow described here is intended to help understand the expected path for booting and configuring. The actual steps to be performed are in the Deploy section.\n Start watching the consoles for ncn-s001 and at least one other storage node Boot all storage nodes at the same time  The first storage node (ncn-s001) will boot; it then starts a loop as ceph-ansible configuration waits for all other storage nodes to boot. The other storage nodes boot and become passive. They will be fully configured when ceph-ansible runs to completion on ncn-s001.   Once ncn-s001 notices that all other storage nodes have booted, ceph-ansible will begin Ceph configuration. This takes several minutes. Once ceph-ansible has finished on ncn-s001, then ncn-s001 waits for ncn-m002 to create /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf. Start watching the consoles for ncn-m002, ncn-m003, and at least one worker node. Boot master nodes (ncn-m002 and ncn-m003) and all worker nodes at the same time.  The worker nodes will boot and wait for ncn-m002 to create the /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane file so that they can join Kubernetes. The third master node (ncn-m003) boots and waits for ncn-m002 to create the /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane file so that it can join Kubernetes The second master node (ncn-m002) boots and runs kubernetes-cloudinit.sh, which will create /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf and /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plan. It then waits for the storage node to create etcd-backup-s3-credentials.   Once ncn-s001 notices that ncn-m002 has created /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf, then ncn-s001 waits for any worker node to become available. As each worker node notices that ncn-m002 has created /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane, they will join the Kubernetes cluster.  Once ncn-s001 notices that a worker node has done this, it moves forward with the creation of ConfigMaps and running the post-Ceph playbooks (S3, OSD pools, quotas, and so on.)   Once ncn-s001 creates etcd-backup-s3-credentials during the ceph-rgw-users role (one of the last roles after Ceph has been set up), then ncn-m001 notices this and proceeds.   NOTE: If several hours have elapsed between storage and master nodes booting, or if there were issues PXE booting master nodes, the cloud-init script on ncn-s001 may not complete successfully. This can cause the /var/log/cloud-init-output.log on master node(s) to continue to output the following message:\n[ 1328.351558] cloud-init[8472]: Waiting for storage node to create etcd-backup-s3-credentials secret... In this case, the following script is safe to be executed again on ncn-s001:\nncn-s001# /srv/cray/scripts/common/storage-ceph-cloudinit.sh After this script finishes, the secrets will be created and the cloud-init script on the master node(s) should complete.\n 3.2 Deploy   Change the default root password and SSH keys\nThe management nodes deploy with a default password in the image, so it is a recommended best practice for system security to change the root password in the image so that it is not the documented default password.\nIt is strongly encouraged to change the default root password and SSH keys in the images used to boot the management nodes. Follow the NCN image customization steps in Change NCN Image Root Password and SSH Keys on PIT Node\n  Create boot directories for any NCN in DNS.\nThis will create folders for each host in /var/www, allowing each host to have its own unique set of artifacts: kernel, initrd, SquashFS, and script.ipxe bootscript.\npit# /root/bin/set-sqfs-links.sh  Every NCN except for ncn-m001 should be included in the output from this script. If that is not the case, then verify that all NCN BMCs are set to use DHCP. See Set node BMCs to DHCP. After that is done, re-run the set-sqfs-links.sh script.\n   Customize boot scripts for any out-of-baseline NCNs\n Worker nodes with more than two small disks need to make adjustments to prevent bare-metal etcd creation. For a brief overview of what is expected, see disk plan of record / baseline.

See LVM Check Failure Recovery.\n3.3.3 Manual LVM check procedure If needed, the LVM checks can be performed manually on the master and worker nodes.\n  Manual check on master nodes:\nncn-m# blkid -L ETCDLVM /dev/sdc   Manual check on worker nodes:\nncn-w# blkid -L CONLIB /dev/sdb2 ncn-w# blkid -L CONRUN /dev/sdb1 ncn-w# blkid -L K8SLET /dev/sdb3   The manual checks are considered successful if all of the blkid commands report a disk device (such as /dev/sdc \u0026ndash; the particular device is unimportant). If any of the lsblk commands return no output, then the check is a failure. Any failures must be resolved before continuing. See the following section for details on how to do so.\n3.3.4 LVM check failure recovery If there are LVM check failures, then the problem must be resolved before continuing with the install.\n  If any master node has the problem, then wipe and redeploy all of the NCNs before continuing the installation:\n Wipe each worker node using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Wipe each master node (except ncn-m001 because it is the PIT node) using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Wipe each storage node using the \u0026lsquo;Full Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Return to the Set each node to always UEFI Network Boot, and ensure they are powered off step of the Deploy Management Nodes section above.    If only worker nodes have the problem, then wipe and redeploy the affected worker nodes before continuing the installation:\n Wipe each affected worker node using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Power off each affected worker node. Return to the Boot the Master and Worker Nodes step of the Deploy Management Nodes section above.  Note: The ipmitool command will give errors trying to power on the unaffected nodes, because they are already powered on \u0026ndash; this is expected and not a problem.      3.4 Check for unused drives on utility storage nodes  IMPORTANT: Do the following if NCNs are Gigabyte hardware. It is suggested (but optional) for HPE NCNs.\nIMPORTANT: Estimate the expected number of OSDs using the following table and using this equation:\ntotal_osds = (number of utility storage/Ceph nodes) * (OSD count from table below for the appropriate hardware)\n    Hardware Manufacturer OSD Drive Count (not including OS drives)     GigaByte 12   HPE 8    Option 1 If there are OSDs on each node (ceph osd tree can show this), then all the nodes are in Ceph. That means the orchestrator can be used to look for the devices.\n  Get the number of OSDs in the cluster.\nncn-s# ceph -f json-pretty osd stat |jq .num_osds 24 IMPORTANT: If the returned number of OSDs is equal to total_osds calculated, then skip the following steps. If not, then proceed with the below additional checks and remediation steps.\n  Compare the number of OSDs to the output (which should resemble the example below). The number of drives will depend on the server hardware.\n NOTE: If the Ceph cluster is large and has a lot of nodes, a node may be specified after the below command to limit the results.\n ncn-s# ceph orch device ls Hostname Path Type Serial Size Health Ident Fault Available ncn-s001 /dev/sda ssd PHYF015500M71P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdb ssd PHYF016500TZ1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdc ssd PHYF016402EB1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdd ssd PHYF016504831P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sde ssd PHYF016500TV1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdf ssd PHYF016501131P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdi ssd PHYF016500YB1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s001 /dev/sdj ssd PHYF016500WN1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sda ssd PHYF0155006W1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdb ssd PHYF0155006Z1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdc ssd PHYF015500L61P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdd ssd PHYF015502631P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sde ssd PHYF0153000G1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdf ssd PHYF016401T41P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdi ssd PHYF016504C21P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s002 /dev/sdj ssd PHYF015500GQ1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sda ssd PHYF016402FP1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdb ssd PHYF016401TE1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdc ssd PHYF015500N51P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdd ssd PHYF0165010Z1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sde ssd PHYF016500YR1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdf ssd PHYF016500X01P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdi ssd PHYF0165011H1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No ncn-s003 /dev/sdj ssd PHYF016500TQ1P9DGN 1920G Unknown N/A N/A No If there are devices that show Available as Yes and they are not being automatically added, that device may need to be zapped.\nIMPORTANT: Prior to zapping any device, ensure that it is not being used.\n  Check to see if the number of devices is less than the number of listed drives in the output from step 1.\nncn-s# ceph orch device ls|grep dev|wc -l 24 If the numbers are equal, but less than the total_osds calculated, then the ceph-mgr daemon may need to be failed in order to get a fresh inventory.\nncn-s# ceph mgr fail $(ceph mgr dump | jq -r .active_name) Wait 5 minutes and then re-check ceph orch device ls.

Be sure to check all of them and not just the final one. A grep command is provided to help with this.\npit# csi pit validate --k8s | tee csi-pit-validate-k8s.log Once that command has finished, the following will extract the test totals reported for each node:\npit# grep \u0026#34;Total Test\u0026#34; csi-pit-validate-k8s.log Example output for a system with five master and worker nodes (excluding the PIT node):\nTotal Tests: 16, Total Passed: 16, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.3072 seconds Total Tests: 16, Total Passed: 16, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2727 seconds Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2841 seconds Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.3622 seconds Total Tests: 12, Total Passed: 12, Total Failed: 0, Total Execution Time: 0.2353 seconds If these total lines report any failed tests, then look through the full output of the test in csi-pit-validate-k8s.log to see which node had the failed test and what the details are for that test.\n WARNING: If there are failures for tests with names like Worker Node CONLIB FS Label, then manual tests should be run on the node which reported the failure. See Manual LVM Check Procedure. If the manual tests fail, then the problem must be resolved before continuing to the next step. See LVM Check Failure Recovery.\n   Ensure that weave has not split-brained\nTo ensure that weave is operating as a single cluster, run the following command on each member of the Kubernetes cluster (master nodes and worker nodes but not the PIT node):\nncn# weave --local status connections | grep failed If the check is successful, there will be no output. If messages like IP allocation was seeded by different peers are seen, then weave appears to be split-brained. At this point, it is necessary to wipe the NCNs and start the PXE boot again:\n Wipe the NCNs using the \u0026lsquo;Basic Wipe\u0026rsquo; section of Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. Return to the \u0026lsquo;Boot the Storage Nodes\u0026rsquo; step of Deploy Management Nodes section above.    5.2 Optional validation   Verify that all the pods in the kube-system namespace are Running or Completed.\nRun the following command on any Kubernetes master or worker node, or the PIT node:\nncn-mw/pit# kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system | grep -Ev \u0026#39;(Running|Completed)\u0026#39; If any pods are listed by this command, it means they are not in the Running or Completed state. That needs to be investigated before proceeding.\n  Verify that the ceph-csi requirements are in place.\nSee Ceph CSI Troubleshooting for details.\n  Important checkpoint Before proceeding, be aware that this is the last point where the other NCN nodes can be rebuilt without also having to rebuild the PIT node. Therefore, take time to double check both the cluster and the validation test results\nNext topic After completing the deployment of the management nodes, the next step is to install the CSM services.\nSee Install CSM Services.\n"

	"content": "Install CSM Installation of the CSM product stream has many steps in multiple procedures which should be done in a specific order. Information about the HPE Cray EX system and the site is used to prepare the configuration payload. The initial node used to bootstrap the installation process is called the PIT node because the Pre-Install Toolkit is installed there. Once the management network switches have been configured, the other management nodes can be deployed with an operating system and the software to create a Kubernetes cluster utilizing Ceph storage. The CSM services provide essential software infrastructure including the API gateway and many micro-services with REST APIs for managing the system. Once administrative access has been configured, the installation of CSM software and nodes can be validated with health checks before doing operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components or the preparation of compute nodes. Once the CSM installation has completed, other product streams for the HPE Cray EX system can be installed.\nTopics  Validate management network cabling Prepare configuration payload Prepare management nodes Bootstrap PIT node Configure management network switches Collect MAC addresses for NCNs Deploy management nodes Install CSM services Validate CSM health Redeploy PIT node Configure administrative access Validate CSM health Configure Prometheus alert notifications Update firmware with FAS Prepare compute nodes Next topic Troubleshooting installation problems  The topics in this chapter need to be done as part of an ordered procedure so are shown here with numbered topics.\nNote: If problems are encountered during the installation, some of the topics do have their own troubleshooting sections, but there is also a general troubleshooting topic.\nDetails \n  Validate management network cabling\nThe cabling should be validated between the nodes and the management network switches. The information in the Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) can be used to confirm the cables which physically connect components of the system. Having the data in the SHCD which matches the physical cabling will be needed later in both Prepare configuration payload and Configure management network switches.\nSee Validate Management Network Cabling.\nNote: If a reinstall or fresh install of this software release is being done on this system and the management network cabling has already been validated, then skip this step and move to Prepare configuration payload. \n  Prepare configuration payload\nInformation gathered from a site survey is needed to feed into the CSM installation process, such as system name, system size, site network information for the CAN, site DNS configuration, site NTP configuration, network information for the node used to bootstrap the installation. Much of the information about the system hardware is encapsulated in the SHCD (Shasta Cabling Diagram), which is a spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing to assemble the components of the system and connect appropriately labeled cables.\nSee Prepare Configuration Payload \n  Prepare management nodes\nSome preparation of the management nodes might be needed before starting an install or reinstall. The preparation includes checking and updating the firmware on the PIT node, quiescing the compute nodes and application nodes, scaling back DHCP on the management nodes, wiping the storage on the management nodes, powering off the management nodes, and possibly powering off the PIT node.\nSee Prepare Management Nodes. \n  Bootstrap PIT node\nThe Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT) node needs to be bootstrapped from the LiveCD. There are two media available to bootstrap the PIT node\u0026ndash;the RemoteISO or a bootable USB device. The recommended media is the RemoteISO, because it does not require any physical media to prepare. However, remotely mounting an ISO on a BMC does not work smoothly for nodes from all vendors. It is recommended to try the RemoteISO first.\nUse one of these procedures to bootstrap the PIT node from the LiveCD:\n Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD Remote ISO (recommended)  Gigabyte BMCs should not use the RemoteISO method. Intel BMCs should not use the RemoteISO method.   Bootstrap Pit Node from LiveCD USB (fallback)  Using the LiveCD USB method requires a USB 3.0 device with at least 1TB of space to create a bootable LiveCD. \n  Configure management network switches\nNow that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD environment and CSI has generated the switch IP addresses, the management network switches can be configured. This procedure will configure the spine switches, aggregation switches (if present), CDU switches (if present), and the leaf switches.\nSee Configure Management Network Switches.\nNote: If a reinstall of this software release is being done on this system and the management network switches have already been configured, then skip this step and move to Collect MAC addresses for NCNs. \n  Collect MAC addresses for NCNs\nNow that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD and the management network switches have been configured, the actual MAC address for the management nodes can be collected. This process will include repetition of some of the steps done up to this point because csi config init will need to be run with the proper MAC addresses.\nSee Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs.\nNote: If a reinstall of this software release is being done on this system and the ncn_metadata.csv file already had valid MAC addresses for both BMC and node interfaces before csi config init was run, then this topic could be skipped and instead move to Deploy management nodes.\nNote: If a first time install of this software release is being done on this system and the ncn_metadata.csv file already had valid MAC addresses for both BMC and node interfaces before csi config init was run, then this topic could be skipped and instead move to Deploy management nodes. \n  Deploy management nodes\nNow that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD and the management network switches have been configured, the other management nodes can be deployed. This procedure will boot all of the management nodes, initialize Ceph storage on the storage nodes and start the Kubernetes cluster on all of the worker nodes and the master nodes, except for the PIT node. The PIT node will join Kubernetes after it is rebooted later in Redeploy PIT node.\nSee Deploy Management Nodes. \n  Install CSM services\nDeployment of management nodes is complete with initialized Ceph storage and a running Kubernetes cluster on all worker and master nodes, except the PIT node. The Nexus repository will be populated with artifacts, containerized CSM services will be installed, and a few other configuration steps will be taken.\nSee Install CSM Services. \n  Validate CSM health\nValidate the health of the management nodes and all CSM services. The reason to do it now is that if there are any problems detected with the core infrastructure or the nodes, it is easy to rewind the installation to Deploy management nodes, because the PIT node has not yet been rebooted. In addition, rebooting the PIT node and deploying the final NCN successfully requires several CSM services to be working properly, so validating this is important.\nNote: At this point of the install, the cray CLI has not yet been configured. Some of the tests (Hardware State Manager Discovery Validation, Booting the CSM Barebones Image on compute nodes, UAS/UAI) require it to be configured in order to run. These tests may be skipped until after the PIT node has been redeployed, but this is not recommended.\nTo enable the cray CLI in order to execute those tests, follow these two procedures before performing the CSM health validation:\n Configure Keycloak Account Configure the cray Command Line Interface (CLI)  To run the CSM health checks, see Validate CSM Health. \n  Redeploy PIT node\nNow that all CSM services have been installed and the CSM health checks completed, with the possible exception of Booting the CSM Barebones Image and the UAS/UAI tests, the PIT node can be rebooted to leave the LiveCD environment and assume its intended role as one the Kubernetes master nodes.\nSee Redeploy PIT Node. \n  Configure administrative access\nNow that all of the CSM services have been installed and the PIT node has been redeployed, administrative access can be prepared. This may include configuring Keycloak with a local Keycloak account or confirming Keycloak is properly federating LDAP or other Identity Provider (IdP), initializing the Cray command line interface for administrative commands, locking the management nodes from accidental actions such as firmware updates by FAS or power actions by CAPMC, configuring the CSM layer of configuration by CFS in NCN personalization,and configuring the node BMCs (node controllers) for nodes in liquid cooled cabinets.\nSee Configure Administrative Access. \n  Validate CSM health\nNow that all management nodes have joined the Kubernetes cluster, CSM services have been installed, and administrative access has been enabled, the health of the management nodes and all CSM services should be validated. There are no exceptions to running the tests\u0026ndash;all can be run now.\nThis CSM health validation can also be run at other points during the system lifecycle, such as when replacing a management node, checking the health after a management node has rebooted because of a crash, as part of doing a full system power down or power up, or after other types of system maintenance.\nSee Validate CSM Health. \n  Configure Prometheus alert notifications\nNow that CSM has been installed and health has been validated, if the system management health monitoring tools and specifically, Prometheus, are found to be useful, email notifications can be configured for specific alerts defined in Prometheus. Prometheus upstream documentation can be leveraged for an Alert Notification Template Reference as well as Notification Template Examples. Currently supported notification types include Slack, Pager Duty, email, or a custom integration via a generic webhook interface.\nSee Configure Prometheus Email Alert Notifications for an example configuration of an email alert notification for the Postgres replication alerts that are defined on the system. \n  Update firmware with FAS\nNow that all management nodes and CSM services have been validated as healthy, the firmware on other components in the system can be checked and updated. The Firmware Action Service (FAS) communicates with many devices on the system. FAS can be used to update the firmware for all of the devices it communicates with at once, or specific devices can be targeted for a firmware update.\nIMPORTANT: Before FAS can be used to update firmware, refer to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center for information about how to install the HPE Cray EX HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) product. The installation of HFP will inform FAS of the newest firmware available. Once FAS is aware that new firmware is available, then see Update Firmware with FAS.\n  \n  Prepare compute nodes\nAfter completion of the firmware update with FAS, compute nodes can be prepared. Some compute node types have special preparation steps, but most compute nodes are ready to be used now.\nThese compute node types require preparation:\n HPE Apollo 6500 XL645D Gen10 Plus Gigabyte  See Prepare Compute Nodes \n  Next topic\nAfter completion of the firmware update with FAS and the preparation of compute nodes, the CSM product stream has been fully installed and configured. Refer to the 1.5 HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide S-8000 on the HPE Customer Support Center for more information on other product streams to be installed and configured after CSM. \n  Troubleshooting installation problems\nThe installation of the Cray System Management (CSM) product requires knowledge of the various nodes and switches for the HPE Cray EX system. The procedures in this section should be referenced during the CSM install for additional information on system hardware, troubleshooting, and administrative tasks related to CSM. See Troubleshooting Installation Problems.\n  "

Initialize bootstrap registry  NOTE The bootstrap registry runs in a default Nexus configuration, which is started and populated in this section. It only exists during initial CSM install on the PIT node in order to bootstrap CSM services. Once CSM install is completed and the PIT node is rebooted as an NCN, the bootstrap Nexus no longer exists.\n   Verify that Nexus is running:\npit# systemctl status nexus   Verify that Nexus is ready. (Any HTTP response other than 200 OK indicates Nexus is not ready.)\npit# curl -sSif http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/status/writable Expected output looks similar to the following:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 04 Feb 2021 05:27:44 GMT Server: Nexus/3.25.0-03 (OSS) X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff Content-Length: 0   Load the Skopeo image installed by the cray-nexus RPM:\npit# podman load -i /var/lib/cray/container-images/cray-nexus/skopeo-stable.tar quay.io/skopeo/stable   Use skopeo sync to upload container images from the CSM release:\npit# export CSM_RELEASE=csm-x.y.z pit# podman run --rm --network host -v /var/www/ephemeral/${CSM_RELEASE}/docker/dtr.dev.cray.com:/images:ro quay.io/skopeo/stable sync \\ --scoped --src dir --dest docker --dest-tls-verify=false --dest-creds admin:admin123 /images localhost:5000  NOTE As the bootstrap Nexus uses the default configuration, the above command uses the default admin credentials (admin user with password admin123) in order to upload to the bootstrap registry, which is listening on localhost:5000.\n   2. Create Site-Init secret The site-init secret in the loftsman namespace makes /var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml available to product installers. The site-init secret should only be updated when the corresponding customizations.yaml data is changed, such as during system installation or upgrade. Create the site-init secret to contain /var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml:\npit# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=/var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml Expected output looks similar to the following:\nsecret/site-init created  NOTE If the site-init secret already exists then kubectl will error with a message similar to:\nError from server (AlreadyExists): secrets \u0026#34;site-init\u0026#34; already exists In this case, delete the site-init secret and recreate it.\n  First delete it:\npit# kubectl delete secret -n loftsman site-init Expected output looks similar to the following:\nsecret \u0026#34;site-init\u0026#34; deleted   Then recreate it:\npit# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=/var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/customizations.yaml Expected output looks similar to the following:\nsecret/site-init created   WARNING If for some reason the system customizations need to be modified to complete product installation, administrators must first update customizations.yaml in the site-init Git repository, which may no longer be mounted on any cluster node, and then delete and recreate the site-init secret as shown below.\nTo read customizations.yaml from the site-init secret:\nncn# kubectl get secrets -n loftsman site-init -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.customizations\\.yaml}\u0026#39; | base64 -d \u0026gt; customizations.yaml To delete the site-init secret:\nncn# kubectl -n loftsman delete secret site-init To recreate the site-init secret:\nncn# kubectl create secret -n loftsman generic site-init --from-file=customizations.yaml  3. Deploy sealed secret decryption key Deploy the corresponding key necessary to decrypt sealed secrets:\npit# /var/www/ephemeral/prep/site-init/deploy/deploydecryptionkey.sh An error similar to the following may occur when deploying the key:\nError from server (NotFound): secrets \u0026#34;sealed-secrets-key\u0026#34; not found W0304 17:21:42.749101 29066 helpers.go:535] --dry-run is deprecated and can be replaced with --dry-run=client. secret/sealed-secrets-key created Restarting sealed-secrets to pick up new keys No resources found This is expected and can safely be ignored.\n4. Deploy CSM applications and services  NOTE: During this step, only on systems with only three worker nodes (typically Testing and Development Systems (TDS)), the customizations.yaml file will be automatically edited to lower pod CPU requests for some services, in order to better facilitate scheduling on smaller systems. See the file: /var/www/ephemeral/${CSM_RELEASE}/tds_cpu_requests.yaml for these settings. This file can be modified with different values (prior to executing the yapl command below), if other settings are desired in the customizations.yaml file for this system. For more information about modifying customizations.yaml and tuning for specific systems, see Post Install Customizations.\n Run install.sh to deploy CSM applications services. This command may take 25 minutes or more to run.\n NOTE install.sh requires various system configuration which are expected to be found in the locations used in proceeding documentation; however, it needs to know SYSTEM_NAME in order to find metallb.yaml and sls_input_file.json configuration files.\nSome commands will also need to have the CSM_RELEASE variable set.\nVerify that the SYSTEM_NAME and CSM_RELEASE environment variables are set:\npit# echo $SYSTEM_NAME pit# echo $CSM_RELEASE If they are not set perform the following:\npit# export SYSTEM_NAME=eniac pit# export CSM_RELEASE=csm-x.y.z  pit# cd /var/www/ephemeral/$CSM_RELEASE pit# ./install.sh On success, install.sh will output OK to stderr and exit with status code 0, e.g.:\npit# ./install.sh ... + CSM applications and services deployed install.sh: OK In the event that install.sh does not complete successfully, consult the known issues below to resolve potential problems and then try running install.sh again.\nIMPORTANT: If you have to re-run install.sh to re-deploy failed ceph-csi provisioners you must make sure to delete the jobs that have not completed. These are left there for investigation on failure. They are automatically removed on a successful deployment.\npit# kubectl get jobs NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE cray-ceph-csi-cephfs 0/1 3m35s cray-ceph-csi-rbd 0/1 8m36s  If these jobs exist then kubectl delete job \u0026lt;jobname\u0026gt; before running install.sh again.\n 5. Setup Nexus Run ./lib/setup-nexus.sh to configure Nexus and upload CSM RPM repositories, container images, and Helm charts. This command may take 20 minutes or more to run.\npit# ./lib/setup-nexus.sh On success, setup-nexus.sh will output to OK on stderr and exit with status code 0, e.g.:\npit# ./lib/setup-nexus.sh ... + Nexus setup complete setup-nexus.sh: OK In the event of an error, consult Troubleshoot Nexus to resolve potential problems and then try running setup-nexus.sh again. Note that subsequent runs of setup-nexus.sh may report FAIL when uploading duplicate assets. This is okay as long as setup-nexus.sh outputs setup-nexus.sh: OK and exits with status code 0.\n6. Set Management NCNs to use Unbound First, verify that SLS properly reports all management NCNs in the system:\npit# ./lib/list-ncns.sh On success, each management NCN will be output, e.g.:\npit# ./lib/list-ncns.sh + Getting admin-client-auth secret + Obtaining access token + Querying SLS ncn-m001 ncn-m002 ncn-m003 ncn-s001 ncn-s002 ncn-s003 ncn-w001 ncn-w002 ncn-w003 If any management NCNs are missing from the output, take corrective action before proceeding.\nNext, run lib/set-ncns-to-unbound.sh to SSH to each management NCN and update /etc/resolv.conf to use Unbound as the nameserver.\npit# ./lib/set-ncns-to-unbound.sh  NOTE If passwordless SSH is not configured, the administrator will have to enter the corresponding password as the script attempts to connect to each NCN.\n On success, the nameserver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf will be printed for each management NCN, e.g.,:\npit# ./lib/set-ncns-to-unbound.sh + Getting admin-client-auth secret + Obtaining access token + Querying SLS + Updating ncn-m001 Password: ncn-m001: nameserver 127.0.0.1 ncn-m001: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-m002 Password: ncn-m002: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-m003 Password: ncn-m003: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-s001 Password: ncn-s001: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-s002 Password: ncn-s002: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-s003 Password: ncn-s003: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-w001 Password: ncn-w001: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-w002 Password: ncn-w002: nameserver 10.92.100.225 + Updating ncn-w003 Password: ncn-w003: nameserver 10.92.100.225  NOTE The script connects to ncn-m001 which will be the PIT node, whose password may be different from that of the other NCNs.\n 7. Apply pod priorities Run the add_pod_priority.sh script to create and apply a pod priority class to services critical to CSM. This will give these services a higher priority than others to ensure they get scheduled by Kubernetes in the event that resources limited on smaller deployments.\npit# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0.1/scripts/upgrade/add_pod_priority.sh Creating csm-high-priority-service pod priority class priorityclass.scheduling.k8s.io/csm-high-priority-service configured Patching cray-postgres-operator deployment in services namespace deployment.apps/cray-postgres-operator patched Patching cray-postgres-operator-postgres-operator-ui deployment in services namespace deployment.apps/cray-postgres-operator-postgres-operator-ui patched Patching istio-operator deployment in istio-operator namespace deployment.apps/istio-operator patched Patching istio-ingressgateway deployment in istio-system namespace deployment.apps/istio-ingressgateway patched . . . After running the add_pod_priority.sh script, the affected pods will be restarted as the pod priority class is applied to them.\n NOTE If the script doesn\u0026rsquo;t finish and ends up looping on this message longer than several minutes:\nSleeping for ten seconds waiting for 3 pods in cray-bss-etcd etcd cluster Sleeping for ten seconds waiting for 3 pods in cray-bss-etcd etcd cluster Sleeping for ten seconds waiting for 3 pods in cray-bss-etcd etcd cluster Refer to Restore an etcd Cluster from a Backup for instructions on how to repair the cray-bss-etcd cluster, and then re-run the add_pod_priority.sh script.\n 8. Apply After Sysmgmt Manifest Workarounds Follow the workaround instructions for the after-sysmgmt-manifest breakpoint.\n9. Wait for everything to settle Wait at least 15 minutes to let the various Kubernetes resources initialize and start before proceeding with the rest of the install. Because there are a number of dependencies between them, some services are not expected to work immediately after the install script completes.\n10. Known issues 10.1 install.sh Known Issues The install.sh script changes cluster state and should not simply be rerun in the event of a failure without careful consideration of the specific error. It may be possible to resume installation from the last successful command executed by install.sh, but administrators will need to appropriately modify install.sh to pick up where the previous run left off. (Note: The install.sh script runs with set -x, so each command will be printed to stderr prefixed with the expanded value of PS4, namely, +.)\nThe following error may occur during install.sh:\n+ csi upload-sls-file --sls-file /var/www/ephemeral/prep/eniac/sls_input_file.json 2021/10/05 18:42:58 Retrieving S3 credentials ( sls-s3-credentials ) for SLS 2021/10/05 18:42:58 Unable to SLS S3 secret from k8s:secrets \u0026#34;sls-s3-credentials\u0026#34; not found   Verify that the sls-s3-credentials secret exists in the default namespace:\npit# kubectl get secret sls-s3-credentials Example output:\nNAME TYPE DATA AGE sls-s3-credentials Opaque 7 28d   Check for running sonar-sync jobs. If there are no sonar-sync jobs, then wait for one to complete. The sonar-sync CronJob is responsible for copying the sls-s3-credentials secret from the default namespace to the services namespace.\npit# kubectl -n services get pods -l cronjob-name=sonar-sync Example output:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE sonar-sync-1634322840-4fckz 0/1 Completed 0 73s sonar-sync-1634322900-pnvl6 1/1 Running 0 13s   Verify that the sls-s3-credentials secret now exists in the services namespace.\npit# kubectl -n services get secret sls-s3-credentials Example output:\nNAME TYPE DATA AGE sls-s3-credentials Opaque 7 20s   Running install.sh again is expected to succeed.\n  11.

The NIC is also referred to as the Embedded LOM (LAN On Motherboard) and is available to the booted OS. This shared port is plugged into a port on the TOR Ethernet switch designated for the Hardware Management Network (HMN) causing the NIC to get an IP address assigned to it from the wrong pool. To prevent this from happening, the iLO VLAN tag needs to be configured for VLAN 4 and the switch port the NIC/shared iLO is plugged into needs to be configured to allow only VLAN 4 traffic. This prevents the NIC from communicating over the switch and it will no longer DHCP an IP address.\nThis procedure needs to be done for each of the HPE Apollo 6500 XL645d servers that will be managed by CSM software. River compute nodes always index their BMCs from 1. For example, the compute BMCs in servers with more than one node will have component names (xnames) as follows: x3000c0s30b1, x3000c0s30b2, x3000c0s30b3, and so on. The node indicator is always a 0.

	"content": "Prepare Configuration Payload The configuration payload consists of the information which must be known about the HPE Cray EX system so it can be passed to the csi (Cray Site Init) program during the CSM installation process.\nInformation gathered from a site survey is needed to feed into the CSM installation process, such as system name, system size, site network information for the CAN, site DNS configuration, site NTP configuration, network information for the node used to bootstrap the installation. More detailed component level information about the system hardware is encapsulated in the SHCD (Shasta Cabling Diagram), which is a spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing to assemble the components of the system and connect appropriately labeled cables.\nHow the configuration payload is prepared depends on whether this is a first time install of CSM software on this system or the CSM software is being reinstalled. The reinstall scenario has the advantage of being able to use the configuration payload from a previous first time install of CSM and an extra configuration file which that generated.\nTopics  Command Line Configuration Payload Configuration Payload Files First Time Install Reinstall Next Topic  Command Line Configuration Payload This information from a site survey can be given to the csi command as command line arguments. The information is shown here to explain what data is needed. It will not be used until moving to the procedure Bootstrap PIT Node\nThe air-cooled cabinet is known to csi as a river cabinet. The liquid-cooled cabinets are either mountain or hill (if a TDS system).\nFor more description of these settings and the default values, see Default IP Address Ranges and the other topics in CSM Overview\n   CSI option Information     --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user root Administrative account for the management node BMCs   --bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass changeme Password for bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user account   --system-name eniac Name of the HPE Cray EX system   --mountain-cabinets 4 Number of Mountain cabinets, but this could also be in cabinets.yaml   --starting-mountain-cabinet 1000 Starting Mountain cabinet ID   --hill-cabinets 0 Number of Hill cabinets, but this could also be in cabinets.yaml   --river-cabinets 1 Number of River cabinets, but this could also be in cabinets.yaml   --can-cidr 10.103.11.0/24 IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system   --can-external-dns 10.103.11.113 IP address on CAN for this system\u0026rsquo;s DNS server   --can-gateway 10.103.11.1 Virtual IP address for the CAN (on the spine switches)   --can-static-pool 10.103.11.112/28 MetalLB static pool on CAN   --can-dynamic-pool 10.103.11.128/25 MetalLB dynamic pool on CAN   --hmn-cidr 10.254.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for River HMN   --nmn-cidr 10.252.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for River NMN   --hmn-mtn-cidr 10.104.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for Mountain HMN   --nmn-mtn-cidr 10.100.0.0/17 Override the default cabinet IPv4 subnet for Mountain NMN   --ntp-pools time.nist.gov External NTP pool(s) for this system to use   --site-domain dev.cray.com Domain name for this system   --site-ip 172.30.53.79/20 IP address and netmask for the PIT node lan0 connection   --site-gw 172.30.48.1 Gateway for the PIT node to use   --site-nic p1p2 NIC on the PIT node to become lan0   --site-dns 172.30.84.40 Site DNS servers to be used by the PIT node   --install-ncn-bond-members p1p1,p10p1 NICs on each management node to become bond0   --application-node-config-yaml application_node_config.yaml Name of application_node_config.yaml   --cabinets-yaml cabinets.yaml Name of cabinets.yaml   --bgp-peers aggregation Override the default BGP peers, using aggregation switches instead of spines     This is a long list of options. It can be helpful to create a Bash script file to call the csi command with all of these options, and then edit that file to adjust the values for the particular system being installed. The bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user and bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass must match what is used for the BMC account and its password for the management nodes. Set site parameters (site-domain, site-ip, site-gw, site-nic, site-dns) for the information which connects ncn-m001 (the PIT node) to the site. The site-nic is the interface on this node connected to the site. There are other interfaces possible, but the install-ncn-bond-members are typically:  p1p1,p10p1 for HPE nodes p1p1,p1p2 for Gigabyte nodes p801p1,p801p2 for Intel nodes The starting cabinet number for each type of cabinet (for example, starting-mountain-cabinet) has a default that can be overridden. See the csi config init --help output for more information.   An override to default cabinet IPv4 subnets can be made with the hmn-mtn-cidr and nmn-mtn-cidr parameters. Several parameters (can-gateway, can-cidr, can-static-pool, can-dynamic-pool) describe the CAN (Customer Access network).  The can-gateway is the common gateway IP address used for both spine switches and commonly referred to as the Virtual IP address for the CAN. The can-cidr is the IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system. The can-static-pool and can-dynamic-pool are the MetalLB address static and dynamic pools for the CAN. The can-external-dns is the static IP address assigned to the DNS instance running in the cluster to which requests the cluster subdomain will be forwarded. The can-external-dns IP address must be within the can-static-pool range.   Set ntp-pools to reachable NTP pools. The application_node_config.yaml file is required. It is used to describe the mapping between prefixes in hmn_connections.csv and HSM subroles. This file also defines aliases application nodes. For details, see Create Application Node YAML. For systems that use non-sequential cabinet ID numbers, use cabinets-yaml to include the cabinets.yaml file. This file can include information about the starting ID for each cabinet type and number of cabinets which have separate command line options, but is a way to specify explicitly the ID of every cabinet in the system. See Create Cabinets YAML.  Configuration Payload Files A few configuration files are needed for the installation of CSM. These are all provided to the csi command during the installation process.\n   Filename Source Information     cabinets.yaml SHCD The number and type of air-cooled and liquid-cooled cabinets. cabinet IDs, and VLAN numbers   application_node_config.yaml SHCD The number and type of application nodes with mapping from the name in the SHCD to the desired hostname   hmn_connections.json SHCD The network topology for HMN of the entire system   ncn_metadata.csv SHCD, other The number of master, worker, and storage nodes and MAC address information for BMC and bootable NICs   switch_metadata.csv SHCD Inventory of all spine, aggregation, CDU, and leaf switches    Although some information in these files can be populated from site survey information, the SHCD prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing is the best source of data for hmn_connections.json. The ncn_metadata.csv does require collection of MAC addresses from the management nodes because that information is not present in the SHCD.\ncabinets.yaml The cabinets.yaml file describes the type of cabinets in the system, the number of each type of cabinet, and the starting cabinet ID for every cabinet in the system. This file can be used to indicate that a system has non-contiguous cabinet ID numbers or non-standard VLAN numbers.\nThe component names (xnames) used in the other files should fit within the cabinet IDs defined by the starting cabinet ID for River cabinets (modified by the number of cabinets). It is OK for management nodes not to be in x3000 (as the first River cabinet), but they must be in one of the River cabinets. For example, x3000 with two cabinets would mean x3000 or x3001 should have all management nodes.\nSee Create Cabinets YAML for instructions about creating this file.\napplication_node_config.yaml The application_node_config.yaml file controls how the csi config init command finds and treats application nodes discovered in the hmn_connections.json file when building the SLS Input file.\nDifferent node prefixes in the SHCD can be identified as Application nodes. Each node prefix can be mapped to a specific HSM sub role. These sub roles can then be used as the targets of Ansible plays run by CFS to configure these nodes. The component name (xname) for each Application node can be assigned one or more hostname aliases.\nSee Create Application Node YAML for instructions about creating this file.\nhmn_connections.json The hmn_connections.json file is extracted from the HMN tab of the SHCD spreadsheet. The CSM release includes the hms-shcd-parser container; this container can do the extraction on the PIT node booted from the LiveCD (RemoteISO or USB device) or on a Linux system. Although some information in these files can be populated from site survey information, the SHCD prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing is the best source of data for hmn_connections.json.\nNo action is required to create this file at this point, and will be created when the PIT node is bootstrapped.\nncn_metadata.csv The information in the ncn_metadata.csv file identifies each of the management nodes, assigns the function as a master, worker, or storage node, and provides the MAC address information needed to identify the BMC and the NIC which will be used to boot the node.\nFor each management node, the component name (xname), role, and subrole can be extracted from the SHCD. However, the rest of the MAC address information needs to be collected another way. Collect as much information as possible before the PIT node is booted from the LiveCD and then get the rest later when directed. See the scenarios which enable partial data collection below in First Time Install.\nSee Create NCN Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\nswitch_metadata.csv The switch_metadata.csv file is manually created to include information about all spine, aggregation, CDU, and leaf switches in the system. None of the Slingshot switches for the HSN should be included in this file.\nSee Create Switch Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\nFirst Time Install The process to install for the first time must collect the information needed to create these files.\n  Collect data for cabinets.yaml\nSee Create Cabinets YAML for instructions about creating this file.\n  Collect data for application_node_config.yaml\nSee Create Application Node YAML for instructions about creating this file.\n  Collect data for ncn_metadata.csv\nSee Create NCN Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\n  Collect data for switch_metadata.csv\nSee Create Switch Metadata CSV for instructions about creating this file.\n  Reinstall The process to reinstall must have the configuration payload files available.\n  Collect Payload for Reinstall\n  These files from a previous install are needed to do a reinstall.\n application_node_config.yaml (if used previously) cabinets.yaml (if used previously) hmn_connections.json ncn_metadata.csv switch_metadata.csv system_config.yaml  If the system_config.yaml is not available, then a reinstall cannot be done. Switch to the install process and generate any of the other files for the Configuration Payload Files which are missing.\n  The command line options used to call csi config init are not needed.\nWhen doing a reinstall, all of the command line options which had been given to csi config init during the previous installation will be found inside the system_config.yaml file. This simplifies the reinstall process.\nWhen you are ready to bootstrap the LiveCD, it will indicate when to run this command without any extra command line options. It will expect to find all of the above files in the current working directory.\nlinux# csi config init     Next Topic After completing this procedure the next step is to prepare the management nodes.

	"content": "Configure Aruba Spine Switch This page describes how Aruba spine switches are configured.\nDepending on the size of the HPE Cray EX system, the spine switches will serve different purposes. On TDS systems, the NCNs will plug directly into the spine switches. On larger systems with aggregation switches, the spine switches will provide connection between the aggregation switches.\nSwitch models used: JL635A Aruba 8325-48Y8C and JL636A Aruba 8325-32C\nThey run in a high availability pair and use VSX to provide redundancy.\nPrerequisites  Three connections between the switches, two of these are used for the Inter switch link (ISL), and one used for the keepalive. Connectivity to the switch is established. The Configure Aruba Management Network Base procedure has been run. The ISL uses 100GB ports and the keepalive will be a 100GB port on the JL636A and a 25GB port on the JL635A.  The following is an example snippet from a spine switch on the SHCD.\nThe ISL ports are 31 and 32 on both spine switches.

	"content": "Configure Dell CDU switch This page describes how Dell CDU switches are configured.\nCDU switches are located in liquid-cooled cabinets and provide connectivity to MTN (Mountain) components. CDU switches act as leaf switches in the architecture. They run in a high availability pair and use VLT to provide redundancy.\nPrerequisites  Two uplinks from each CDU switch to the upstream switch, this is normally a spine switch. Connectivity to the switch is established. Three connections between the switches, two of these are used for the VLT interconnect (VLTi), and one used for the keepalive. The VLTi uses two 100gb links between the switches.  Here are example snippets from a CDU switch in the SHCD.\nThe uplinks are port 51 and 52 on both CDU switches. These go to sw-100g01 and sw-100g2 which are spine 1 and 2.\nThe ISL are ports 49 and 50 on both CDU switches.\nThe Keepalive is port 48.\nNOTE: The following are only examples; installation and cabling may vary.

Switch IP addresses are generated by Cray Site Init (CSI).\nThe configuration steps are different for these switch vendors. The switch configuration procedures for HPE Aruba will be grouped separately from the switch configuration procedures for other vendors.\nIt is assumed that the administrator configuring the Management Network has a basic understanding of networking protocols (STP, VLAN, OSPF, LAG/MLAG, BGP, etc.), and knows how to configure network equipment. It is also assumed that they understand and know how to read an SHCD file.\nBefore configuring/reconfiguring any switches, make sure to get the current running configuration and save that in case the configuration must be reverted.\nAll switch configuration should be done with a console or out of band connection.\nSave the output of the following:\n# show run Topics\n HPE Aruba switch configuration Dell and Mellanox switch configuration Next Topic  Details HPE Aruba Switch Configuration The management network switches should be configured in this order: Spine, Aggregation (if present), CDU (if present), and Leaf.

	"content": "Create Application Node Config YAML This topic provides directions on constructing the application_node_config.yaml file. This file controls how the csi config init command finds and treats application nodes discovered in the hmn_connections.json file when generating configuration files for the system.\n Prerequisites Background Directions  Prerequisites The application_node_config.yaml file can be constructed from information from one of the following sources:\n The SHCD Excel spreadsheet for the system The hmn_connections.json file generated from the system\u0026rsquo;s SHCD  Background SHCD and hmn_connections.json The HMN tab of the SHCD describes the air-cooled hardware present in the system and how these devices are connected to the Hardware Management Network (HMN). This information is required by CSM to perform hardware discovery and geolocation of air-cooled hardware in the system. The HMN tab may contain other hardware that is not managed by CSM, but is connected to the HMN.\nThe hmn_connections.json file is derived from the HMN tab of a system SHCD, and is one of the seed files required by Cray Site Init (CSI) command to generate configuration files required to install CSM. The hmn_connections.json file is almost a one-to-one copy of the right-hand table in the HMN tab of the SHCD. It is an array of JSON objects, and each object represents a row from the HMN tab. Any row that is not understood by CSI will be ignored, this includes any additional devices connected to the HMN that are not managed by CSM.\nFor a detailed mapping between the data in the SHCD and the equivalent information in the hmn_connections.json file, see Introduction to SHCD HMN Connections Rules.\nWhat is a Source Name? The source name is the name of the device that is being connected to the HMN network. In the SHCD HMN tab, this is in a column with the header Source or the Source field in the element of the hmn_connections.json for this device. From this source name, the csi config init command can infer the type of hardware that is connected to the HMN network (Node BMC, PDU, HSN Switch, BMC, and more).\nExample SHCD row from HMN tab with column headers representing an application node with SourceName uan01 in cabinet x3000 in slot 19. Its BMC is connected to port 37 of the management leaf switch in x3000 in slot 14.\n   Source (J20) Rack (K20) Location (L20) (M20) Parent (N20) (O20) Port (P20) Destination (Q20) Rack (R20) Location (S20) (T20) Port (U20)     uan01 x3000 u19   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u14 - j37    Example hmn_connections.json row representing an application node with SourceName uan01 in cabinet x3000 in slot 19.

In general, everything in the HMN tab of the SHCD or hmn_connections.json file that starts with uan, gn, or ln, are considered application nodes and any node that does not follow the SHCD/HMN Connections Rules should also be considered an application node, unless it is a KVM.\nIf the hmn_connections.json file is not available, then use the HMN tab of SHCD spreadsheet. This table is equivalent to the example hmn_connections.json output below.\n   Source (J20) Rack (K20) Location (L20) (M20) Parent (N20) (O20) Port (P20) Destination (Q20) Rack (R20) Location (S20) (T20) Port (U20)     gateway01 x3000 u29   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j42   login02 x3000 u28   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j43   lnet01 x3000 u27   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j41   vn01 x3000 u25   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j40   uan01 x3000 u23   - j3 sw-smn01 x3000 u32 - j39    If the hmn_connections.json file is available, then the following command can be used to show the HMN rows that are application nodes.\nlinux# cat hmn_connections.json | jq -rc \u0026#39;.[] | select(.Source | test(\u0026#34;^((mn|wn|sn|nid|cn|cn\\\\-|pdu)\\\\d+|.*(cmc|rcm|kvm|door).*|x\\\\d+p\\\\d*|sw-.+|columbia$)\u0026#34;; \u0026#34;i\u0026#34;) | not)\u0026#39;  Example hmn_connections.json output:\n{\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;gateway01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u29\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j42\u0026#34;}, {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;login02\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u28\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j43\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;lnet01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u27\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j41\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;vn01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u25\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j40\u0026#34;}, {\u0026#34;Source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;uan01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SourceLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u23\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationRack\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;x3000\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationLocation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;u32\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;DestinationPort\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;j39\u0026#34;},   Add additional application node prefixes.\nThe prefixes field is an array of strings, that augments the list of source name prefixes that are treated as application nodes. By default, csi config init only looks for application nodes that have source names that start with uan, gn, and ln. If the system contains application nodes that fall outside of those source name prefixes, then additional prefixes must be added to application_node_config.yaml. These additional prefixes will be used in addition to the default prefixes.\nTo add an additional prefix, append a new string element to the prefixes array.\n NOTE: The command csi config init does a case insensitive check for whether a source name contains an application node prefix. For example, the prefix uan will match uan, Uan, and UAN.\n From the HMN example above, the following additional prefixes are required:\n# Additional application node prefixes to match in the hmn_connections.json file prefixes: - gateway - login - lnet - vn   Add HSM SubRoles for application node prefixes.\nThe prefix_hsm_subroles field mapping application node prefix (string) to the applicable Hardware State Manager (HSM) SubRole (string) for the application nodes. All applications nodes have the HSM Role of Application, and the SubRole value can be used to label what type of the application node it is (such as UAN, Gateway, LNETRouter, and more).\nBy default, the csi config init command will use the following SubRoles for application nodes:\n   Prefix HSM SubRole     uan UAN   ln UAN   gn Gateway    If there are no additional prefixes in the SHCD or no desire to use a different HSM SubRole than the default, then this prefix_hsm_subroles field does not need any data populated.\nTo add additional HSM SubRole for a given prefix, add a new mapping under the prefix_hsm_subroles field. Where the key is the application node prefix and the value is the HSM SubRole.\nValid HSM SubRoles values are: Worker, Master, Storage, UAN, Gateway, LNETRouter, Visualization, and UserDefined.\nFrom the HMN example above, the following additional prefix HSM SubRole mappings are required:\n# Additional HSM SubRoles prefix_hsm_subroles: login: UAN lnet: LNETRouter gateway: Gateway vn: Visualization   Add application node aliases.\nThe aliases field is a map of component name (xname) strings to an array of alias strings.\n For guidance on building application node component names (xnames), follow one of the following:\n Building component names (xnames) for nodes in a single application node chassis Building component names (xnames) for nodes in a dual application node chassis   By default, the csi config init command does not set the ExtraProperties.Alias field for application nodes in the SLS input file.\nFor each application node, add its alias mapping under the aliases field. Where the key is the component name (xname) of the application node, and the value is an array of aliases (strings) which allows for one or more aliases to be specified for an application node.\nFrom the HMN example above, the following application node aliases are required:\n# Application Node aliases aliases: x3113c0s29b0n0: [\u0026#34;gateway01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s28b0n0: [\u0026#34;login02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s27b0n0: [\u0026#34;lnet01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s25b0n0: [\u0026#34;visualization01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vn02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s23b0n0: [\u0026#34;uan01\u0026#34;]  The ordering of component names (xnames) under aliases does not matter.\n   Final information in the example application_node_config.yaml built from the HMN example above.\n--- # Additional application node prefixes to match in the hmn_connections.json file prefixes: - gateway - login - lnet - vn # Additional HSM SubRoles prefix_hsm_subroles: login: UAN lnet: LNETRouter gateway: Gateway vn: Visualization # Application Node aliases aliases: x3113c0s29b0n0: [\u0026#34;gateway01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s28b0n0: [\u0026#34;login02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s27b0n0: [\u0026#34;lnet01\u0026#34;] x3113c0s25b0n0: [\u0026#34;visualization01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vn02\u0026#34;] x3113c0s23b0n0: [\u0026#34;uan01\u0026#34;]   "

	"content": "Collecting NCN MAC Addresses This procedure details how to collect the NCN MAC addresses from an HPE Cray EX system. The MAC addresses needed for the Bootstrap MAC, Bond0 MAC0, and Bond0 MAC1 columns in ncn_metadata.csv will be collected. This data will feed into the cloud-init metadata.\nThe Bootstrap MAC address will be used for identification of this node during the early part of the PXE boot process, before the bonded interface can be established.\nBond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 are the MAC addresses for the physical interfaces that the node will use for the various VLANs. Bond0 MAC0 and Bond0 MAC1 should be on different network cards in order to establish redundancy for a failed network card. On the other hand, this is not an absolute requirement. If the node has only a single network card, then this will force MAC1 and MAC0 to reside on the same physical card; while not optimal, this will still produce a valid configuration.\nSections  Procedure: iPXE consoles  Requirements MAC address collection   Procedure: Serial consoles Procedure: Recovering from an incorrect ncn_metadata.csv file  The easy way to do this leverages the NIC dump provided by the metal-ipxe package on the LiveCD. This option is outlined in Procedure: iPXE consoles.\nThe alternative is to use serial cables (or SSH) to collect the MAC addresses from the switch ARP tables. This can become exponentially difficult for large systems, and is not recommended. This option is outlined in Procedure: Serial consoles.\nProcedure: iPXE consoles This procedure is faster for those with the LiveCD (CRAY Pre-Install Toolkit). It can be used to quickly boot-check nodes to dump network device information without an operating system. This works by accessing the PCI configuration space.\nRequirements  If CSI does not work because of a file requirement, then file a ticket. By default, dnsmasq and ConMan are already running on the LiveCD, but bond0 needs to be configured. dnsmasq needs to serve/listen over bond0, and ConMan needs the BMC information.\n  LiveCD dnsmasq is configured for the bond0/metal network (NMN/HMN/CAN do not matter) BMC MAC addresses already collected LiveCD ConMan is configured for each BMC  For help with either of those, see LiveCD Setup.\nMAC address collection   (Optional) Modify the boot so that nodes stop network booting after dumping their network devices.\n NOTE Removing the iPXE script will prevent network booting. Be aware that the nodes may still disk boot.\n pit# mv /var/www/boot/script.ipxe /var/www/boot/script.ipxe.bak   Verify that consoles are active with conman -q.\nThe following command lists all nodes that ConMan is configured to monitor.\npit# conman -q ncn-m002-mgmt ncn-m003-mgmt ncn-s001-mgmt ncn-s002-mgmt ncn-s003-mgmt ncn-w001-mgmt ncn-w002-mgmt ncn-w003-mgmt   Set the nodes to PXE boot and restart them.\n  Record the username for the NCN BMCs.\npit# USERNAME=root   Record the password for this user.\n read -s is used in order to prevent the credentials from being displayed on the screen or recorded in the shell history.\n pit# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD   Set the nodes to PXE boot and restart them.\npit# export IPMI_PASSWORD pit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} chassis bootdev pxe options=persistent pit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} chassis bootdev pxe options=efiboot pit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power off pit# sleep 10 pit# grep -oP \u0026#34;($mtoken|$stoken|$wtoken)\u0026#34; /etc/dnsmasq.d/statics.conf | sort -u | xargs -t -i ipmitool -I lanplus -U $USERNAME -E -H {} power on     Wait for the nodes to network boot.\nThis can be monitored using ConMan; the -m option follows the console output in read-only mode, and the -j option joins an interactive console session. The available node names were listed in step 2 above. The boot usually starts in less than 3 minutes. After that, log data should start flowing through ConMan; the speed depends on how quickly the nodes POST. To see a ConMan help screen for all supported escape sequences, use \u0026amp;?.\npit# conman -m ncn-m002-mgmt   Exit ConMan.\nThis is done by typing \u0026amp;.

	"content": "Configure Administrative Access There are several operations which configure administrative access to different parts of the system. Ensuring that the cray CLI can be used with administrative credentials enables use of many management services via commands. The management nodes can be locked from accidental manipulation by the cray capmc and cray fas commands when the intent is to work on the entire system except the management nodes. The cray scsd command can change the SSH keys, NTP server, syslog server, and BMC/controller passwords.\nTopics  Configure Keycloak account Configure the Cray command line interface Lock management nodes Configure BMC and controller parameters with SCSD Configure non-compute nodes with CFS Upload Olympus BMC recovery firmware into TFTP server Proceed to next topic  NOTE: The procedures in this section of installation documentation are intended to be done in order, even though the topics are administrative or operational procedures. The topics themselves do not have navigational links to the next topic in the sequence.\n1. Configure Keycloak account Upcoming steps in the installation workflow require an account to be configured in Keycloak for authentication. This can be either a local Keycloak account or an external Identity Provider (IdP), such as LDAP. Having an account in Keycloak with administrative credentials enables the use of many management services via the cray command.\nSee Configure Keycloak Account.\n2. Configure the Cray command line interface The cray command line interface (CLI) is a framework created to integrate all of the system management REST APIs into easily usable commands.\nLater procedures in the installation workflow use the cray command to interact with multiple services. The cray CLI configuration needs to be initialized for the Linux account. The Keycloak user who initializes the CLI configuration needs to be authorized for administrative actions.\nSee Configure the Cray command line interface.\n3. Lock management nodes The management nodes are unlocked at this point in the installation. Locking the management nodes and their BMCs will prevent actions from FAS to update their firmware or CAPMC to power off or do a power reset. Doing any of these by accident will take down a management node. If the management node is a Kubernetes master or worker node, this can have serious negative effects on system operation.\nIf a single node is taken down by mistake, it is possible that things will recover. However, if all management nodes are taken down, or all Kubernetes worker nodes are taken down by mistake, the system is dead and has to be completely restarted.\nLock the management nodes and their BMCs now!\nSee Lock and Unlock Nodes.\n4. Configure BMC and controller parameters with SCSD NOTE: If there are no liquid-cooled cabinets present in the HPE Cray EX system, then this step can be skipped.\nThe System Configuration Service (SCSD) allows administrators to set various BMC and controller parameters for components in liquid-cooled cabinets. At this point in the install, SCSD should be used to set the SSH key in the node controllers (BMCs) to enable troubleshooting. If any of the nodes fail to power down or power up as part of the compute node booting process, it may be necessary to look at the logs on the BMC for node power down or node power up.\nSee Configure BMC and Controller Parameters with SCSD.\n5. Configure non-compute nodes with CFS Non-compute Nodes (NCN) need to be configured after booting for administrative access, security, and other purposes. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) is used to apply post-boot configuration in a decoupled, layered manner. Individual software products including CSM provide one or more layers of configuration in a process called \u0026ldquo;NCN personalization\u0026rdquo;.\nSee Configure Non-Compute Nodes with CFS.\n6. Upload Olympus BMC recovery firmware into TFTP server NOTE: This step requires the CSM software, Cray CLI, and HPC Firmware Pack (HFP) to be installed. If these are not currently installed, then skip this step and perform it later.\nThe Olympus hardware needs to have recovery firmware loaded to the cray-tftp server in case the BMC loses its firmware. The BMCs are configured to load a recovery firmware from a TFTP server. This procedure does not modify any BMC firmware, but only stages the firmware on the TFTP server for download in the event it is needed.\nSee Load Olympus BMC Recovery Firmware into TFTP server.\n7. Proceed to next topic After completing the operational procedures above which configure administrative access, the next step is to validate the health of management nodes and CSM services.\nSee Validate CSM Health.\n"

	"content": "Configure Aruba CDU Switch This page describes how Aruba CDU switches are configured.\nCDU switches are located in liquid-cooled cabinets and provide connectivity to MTN (Mountain) components. CDU switches act as leaf switches in the architecture. Aruba JL720A 8360-48XT4 is the model used. They run in a high availability pair and use VSX to provide redundancy.\nPrerequisites  There are two uplinks from each CDU switch to the upstream switch. This is normally a spine switch. Three connections exist between the switches, two of these are used for the Inter switch link (ISL), and one used for the keepalive. Connectivity to the switch is established. The Configure Aruba Management Network Base procedure has been run. The ISL uses 100GB ports and the keepalive uses a 10GB port.  Here are example snippets from a CDU switch in the SHCD.\nThe uplinks are port 51 and 52 on both CDU switches. These go to sw-100g01 and sw-100g2 which are spine 1 and 2.\nThe ISL are ports 49 and 50 on both CDU switches.\nThe Keepalive is port 48.\nNOTE: These are examples only.

This will lead to a situation where not all connected devices are discovered as expected. Further troubleshooting would show that the SNMP walk output would not match \u0026lsquo;show mac-address-table\u0026rsquo; command output from the switch.\nSymptom/Scenario The SNMP walk output of OID BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpFdbAddress returns fewer MAC addresses than the show mac-address-table command.\nWorkaround Delete the SNMP configuration from the affected switch and reconfigure the SNMP server.

	"content": "Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD Remote ISO The Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT) node needs to be bootstrapped from the LiveCD. There are two media available to bootstrap the PIT node\u0026ndash;the RemoteISO or a bootable USB device. This procedure describes using the RemoteISO. If not using the RemoteISO, see Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB\nThe installation process is similar to the USB based installation with adjustments to account for the lack of removable storage.\nImportant: Before starting this procedure be sure to complete the procedure to Prepare Configuration Payload for the relevant installation scenario.\nTopics  Known compatibility issues Attaching and booting the LiveCD with the BMC First login Configure the running LiveCD Next topic  1. Known compatibility issues The LiveCD Remote ISO has known compatibility issues for nodes from certain vendors.\n Intel nodes should not attempt to bootstrap using the LiveCD Remote ISO method. Instead use Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB Gigabyte nodes should not attempt to bootstrap using the LiveCD Remote ISO method. Instead use Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB  2. Attaching and booting the LiveCD with the BMC  Warning: If this is a re-installation on a system that still has a USB device from a prior installation, then that USB device must be wiped before continuing. Failing to wipe the USB, if present, may result in confusion. If the USB is still booted, then it can wipe itself using the basic wipe from Wipe NCN Disks for Reinstallation. If it is not booted, please do so and wipe it or disable the USB ports in the BIOS (not available for all vendors).\n Obtain and attach the LiveCD cray-pre-install-toolkit ISO file to the BMC. Depending on the vendor of the node, the instructions for attaching to the BMC will differ.\n  The CSM software release should be downloaded and expanded for use.\nImportant: To ensure that the CSM release plus any patches, workarounds, or hot fixes are included follow the instructions in Update CSM Product Stream\nThe cray-pre-install-toolkit ISO and other files are now available in the directory from the extracted CSM tar. The ISO will have a name similar to cray-pre-install-toolkit-sle15sp2.x86_64-1.4.10-20210514183447-gc054094.iso\nThis ISO file can be extracted from the CSM release tar file using the following command:\nlinux# tar --wildcards --no-anchored -xzvf \u0026lt;csm-release\u0026gt;.tar.gz \u0026#39;cray-pre-install-toolkit-*.iso\u0026#39; This release of CSM software, the cray-pre-install-toolkit ISO should be placed on a server which the PIT node will be able to contact using HTTP or HTTPS.\nNote: A shorter path name is better than a long path name on the webserver.\n The Cray Pre-Install Toolkit ISO is included in the CSM release tar file. It will have a long filename similar to cray-pre-install-toolkit-sle15sp2.x86_64-1.4.10-20210514183447-gc054094.iso, so pick a shorter name on the webserver.    See the respective procedure below to attach an ISO.\n HPE iLO BMCs Gigabyte BMCs Do not use the RemoteISO method. See Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB Intel BMCs Do not use the RemoteISO method. See Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB    The chosen procedure should have rebooted the server. Observe the server boot into the LiveCD.\n  3. First login On first login (over SSH or at local console) the LiveCD will prompt the administrator to change the password.\n  The initial password is empty; set the username of root and press return twice.\npit login: root Expected output looks similar to the following:\nPassword: \u0026lt;-------just press Enter here for a blank password You are required to change your password immediately (administrator enforced) Changing password for root. Current password: \u0026lt;------- press Enter here, again, for a blank password New password: \u0026lt;------- type new password Retype new password:\u0026lt;------- retype new password Welcome to the CRAY Pre-Install Toolkit (LiveOS)   4.

If the hostname returned by the hostnamectl command is pit, then re-run the csi-set-hostname.sh script with the same parameters. Otherwise, an administrator should set the hostname manually with hostnamectl. In the latter case, do not confuse other administrators by using the hostname ncn-m001.

As a result, the old partition(s) will remain in use. You should reboot now before making further changes. In that case, the following steps may resolve the problem without needing to reboot. These commands will remove volume groups and raid arrays that may be using the disk.

A command line option is required in order for csi to use the file. See Create Application Node YAML. The bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user and bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass must match what is used for the BMC account and its password for the management NCNs. Set site parameters (site-domain, site-ip, site-gw, site-nic, site-dns) for the network information which connects ncn-m001 (the PIT node) to the site. The site-nic is the interface on ncn-m001 that is connected to the site network. There are other interfaces possible, but the install-ncn-bond-members are typically:  p1p1,p10p1 for HPE nodes p1p1,p1p2 for Gigabyte nodes p801p1,p801p2 for Intel nodes   If not using a cabinets-yaml file, then set the three cabinet parameters (mountain-cabinets, hill-cabinets, and river-cabinets) to the quantity of each cabinet type included in this system. The starting cabinet number for each type of cabinet (for example, starting-mountain-cabinet) has a default that can be overridden. See the csi config init --help. For systems that use non-sequential cabinet ID numbers, use the cabinets-yaml argument to include the cabinets.yaml file. This file gives the ability to explicitly specify the ID of every cabinet in the system. When specifying a cabinets.yaml file with the cabinets-yaml argument, other command line arguments related to cabinets will be ignored by csi. See Create Cabinets YAML. An override to default cabinet IPv4 subnets can be made with the hmn-mtn-cidr and nmn-mtn-cidr parameters. By default, spine switches are used as MetalLB peers. Use --bgp-peers aggregation to use aggregation switches instead. Several parameters (can-gateway, can-cidr, can-static-pool, can-dynamic-pool) describe the CAN (Customer Access network). The can-gateway is the common gateway IP address used for both spine switches and commonly referred to as the Virtual IP address for the CAN. The can-cidr is the IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system. The can-static-pool and can-dynamic-pool are the MetalLB address static and dynamic pools for the CAN. The can-external-dns is the static IP address assigned to the DNS instance running in the cluster to which requests the cluster subdomain will be forwarded. The can-external-dns IP address must be within the can-static-pool range. Set ntp-pools to reachable NTP pools  Note: These warnings from csi config init for issues in hmn_connections.json can be ignored.\n  The node with the external connection (ncn-m001) will have a warning similar to this because its BMC is connected to the site and not the HMN like the other management NCNs.

There are two media available to bootstrap the PIT node: the RemoteISO or a bootable USB device. This procedure describes using the USB device. If not using the USB device, see Bootstrap Pit Node from LiveCD Remote ISO.\nThere are 5 overall steps that provide a bootable USB with SSH enabled, capable of installing Shasta v1.5 (or higher).\nTopics  Download and Expand the CSM Release Create the Bootable Media Configuration Payload  Before Configuration Payload Workarounds Generate Installation Files CSI Workarounds Prepare site-init   Prepopulate LiveCD Daemons Configuration and NCN Artifacts Boot the LiveCD  First Login   Next Topic  1.

This may be useful for internal or quick usage. Administrators seeking a Shasta installation must continue on to the configuration payload.\n3. Configuration Payload The SHASTA-CFG structure and other configuration files will be prepared, then csi will generate a system-unique configuration payload. This payload will be used for the rest of the CSM installation on the USB device.\n Before Configuration Payload Workarounds Generate Installation Files CSI Workarounds Prepare site-init  3.1 Before Configuration Payload Workarounds Follow the workaround instructions for the before-configuration-payload breakpoint.\n3.1 Generate Installation Files Some files are needed for generating the configuration payload. See these topics in Prepare Configuration Payload if the information for this system has not yet been prepared.\n Command Line Configuration Payload Configuration Payload Files   Note:: The USB device is usable at this time, but without SSH enabled as well as core services. This means the USB device could be used to boot the system now, and this step can be returned to at another time.\n   At this time see Create HMN Connections JSON for instructions about creating the hmn_connections.json.\n  Change into the preparation directory:\nlinux# mkdir -pv /mnt/pitdata/prep linux# cd /mnt/pitdata/prep   Pull these files into the current working directory:\n application_node_config.yaml (optional - see below) cabinets.yaml (optional - see below) hmn_connections.json ncn_metadata.csv switch_metadata.csv system_config.yaml (only available after first-install generation of system files   The optional application_node_config.yaml file may be provided for further definition of settings relating to how application nodes will appear in HSM for roles and subroles. See Create Application Node YAML\nThe optional cabinets.yaml file allows cabinet naming and numbering as well as some VLAN overrides. See Create Cabinets YAML.\nThe system_config.yaml file is generated by the csi tool during the first install of a system, and can later be used for reinstalls of the system. For the initial install, the information in it must be provided as command line arguments to csi config init.\n   For subsequent fresh-installs (re-installs) where the system_config.yaml parameter file is available, generate the updated system configuration (see Cray site-init Files.\n Warning: If the system_config.yaml file is unavailable, then skip this step and proceed to Initial Installs (bare-metal).\n   Check for the configuration files.

The bootstrap-ncn-bmc-user and bootstrap-ncn-bmc-pass must match what is used for the BMC account and its password for the management NCNs. Set site parameters (site-domain, site-ip, site-gw, site-nic, site-dns) for the network information which connects ncn-m001 (the PIT node) to the site. The site-nic is the interface on ncn-m001 that is connected to the site network. There are other interfaces possible, but the install-ncn-bond-members are typically:  p1p1,p10p1 for HPE nodes p1p1,p1p2 for Gigabyte nodes p801p1,p801p2 for Intel nodes   If not using a cabinets-yaml file, then set the three cabinet parameters (mountain-cabinets, hill-cabinets, and river-cabinets) to the quantity of each cabinet type included in this system. The starting cabinet number for each type of cabinet (for example, starting-mountain-cabinet) has a default that can be overridden. See the csi config init --help. For systems that use non-sequential cabinet ID numbers, use the cabinets-yaml argument to include the cabinets.yaml file. This file gives the ability to explicitly specify the ID of every cabinet in the system. When specifying a cabinets.yaml file with the cabinets-yaml argument, other command line arguments related to cabinets will be ignored by csi. See Create Cabinets YAML. An override to default cabinet IPv4 subnets can be made with the hmn-mtn-cidr and nmn-mtn-cidr parameters. By default, spine switches are used as MetalLB peers. Use --bgp-peers aggregation to use aggregation switches instead. Several parameters (can-gateway, can-cidr, can-static-pool, can-dynamic-pool) describe the CAN (Customer Access network). The can-gateway is the common gateway IP address used for both spine switches and commonly referred to as the Virtual IP address for the CAN. The can-cidr is the IP subnet for the CAN assigned to this system. The can-static-pool and can-dynamic-pool are the MetalLB address static and dynamic pools for the CAN. The can-external-dns is the static IP address assigned to the DNS instance running in the cluster to which requests the cluster subdomain will be forwarded. The can-external-dns IP address must be within the can-static-pool range. Set ntp-pools to reachable NTP pools  Note: These warnings from csi config init for issues in hmn_connections.json can be ignored.\n  The node with the external connection (ncn-m001) will have a warning similar to this because its BMC is connected to the site and not the HMN like the other management NCNs.

The procedure to recover the boards is included below.\n All firmware can be found with HFP package provided with the Shasta release.\n Clear BIOS settings by jumper  Pull the power cables or blade server from the chassis, and open the system top cover.

	"content": "Cray System Management Documentation Scope and Audience The documentation included here describes the Cray System Management (CSM) software, how to install or upgrade CSM software, and related supporting operational procedures to manage an HPE Cray EX system. CSM software is the foundation upon which other software product streams for the HPE Cray EX system depend.\nThe CSM installation prepares and deploys a distributed system across a group of management nodes organized into a Kubernetes cluster which uses Ceph for utility storage. These nodes perform their function as Kubernetes master nodes, Kubernetes worker nodes, or utility storage nodes with the Ceph storage.\nSystem services on these nodes are provided as containerized micro-services packaged for deployment via Helm charts. Kubernetes orchestrates these services and schedules them on Kubernetes worker nodes with horizontal scaling. Horizontal scales increases or decreases the number of service instances as demand for them varies, such as when booting many compute nodes or application nodes.\nThis information is intended for system installers, system administrators, and network administrators of the system. It assumes some familiarity with standard Linux and open source tools, such as shell scripts, revision control with git, configuration management with Ansible, YAML, JSON, and TOML file formats, etc.\nTable of Contents   Introduction to CSM Installation\nThis chapter provides an introduction to using the CSM software to manage the HPE Cray EX system which also describes the scenarios for installation and upgrade of CSM software, how product stream updates for CSM are delivered, the operational activities done after installation for on-going management of the HPE Cray EX system, differences between previous release and this release, and conventions used in this documentation.\n  Update CSM Product Stream\nThis chapter explains how to get the CSM product release, any patches, update to the latest set of documentation and any installation workarounds, and check for any Field Notices or Hotfixes.\n  Install CSM\nThis chapter provides an order list of procedures which can be used for CSM software installation or reinstall that indicate when to do operational tasks as part of the installation workflow. Updating software is in another chapter. Installation of the CSM product stream has many steps in multiple procedures which should be done in a specific order. Information about the HPE Cray EX system and the site is used to prepare the configuration payload. The initial node used to bootstrap the installation process is called the PIT node because the Pre-Install Toolkit is installed there. Once the management network switches have been configured, the other management nodes can be deployed with an operating system and the software to create a Kubernetes cluster utilizing Ceph storage. The CSM services provide essential software infrastructure including the API gateway and many micro-services with REST APIs for managing the system. Once administrative access has been configured, the installation of CSM software and nodes can be validated with health checks before doing operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components or the preparation of compute nodes.\n  Upgrade CSM\nThis chapter provides an order list of procedures which can be used to update CSM software that indicate when to do operational tasks as part of the software upgrade workflow. There are procedures to prepare the HPE Cray system for the upgrade, and update the management network, the management nodes, and the CSM services. After the upgrade of CSM software, the CSM health checks are used to validate the system before doing any other operational tasks like the check and update of firmware on system components.\n  CSM Operational Activities\nThis chapter provides an unordered set of administrative procedures required to operate an HPE Cray EX system with CSM software and grouped into several major areas:\n CSM Product Management Artifact Management Boot Orchestration Compute Rolling Upgrade Configuration Management Console Management Firmware Management Hardware State Manager Image Management Kubernetes Network Management Node Management Package Repository Management Power Management Resiliency River Endpoint Discovery Service Security And Authentication System Configuration Service System Layout Service System Management Health UAS User And Admin Topics Utility Storage Validate CSM Health    CSM Troubleshooting Information\nThis chapter provides information about some known issues in the system and tips for troubleshooting Kubernetes.\n  CSM Background Information\nThis chapter provides background information about the NCNs (non-compute nodes) which function as management nodes for the HPE Cray EX system. This information is not normally needed to install or upgrade software, but provides background which might be helpful for troubleshooting an installation.\n  Glossary\nThis chapter provides explanations of terms and acronyms used throughout the rest of this documentation.\n  Copyright and License MIT License\n(C) Copyright [2020-2022] Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026ldquo;Software\u0026rdquo;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026ldquo;AS IS\u0026rdquo;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The AN is not part of the Kubernetes cluster to which management nodes belong. One special type of AN is the UAN (User Access Node), but different systems may have need for other types of ANs, such as:\n nodes which provide a Lustre routing function (LNet router) gateways between HSN and InfiniBand data movers between two different network file systems visualization servers other special-purpose nodes  Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) Air-Cooled cabinet COTS servers that include a Redfish-enabled baseboard management controller (BMC) and REST endpoint for API control and management. Either IPMI commands or REST API calls can be used to manage a BMC.\nBlade Switch Controller (sC) The Slingshot blade switch embedded controller (sC) provides a hardware management REST endpoint to monitor environmental conditions and manage the blade power, switch ASIC, FPGA buffer/interfaces, and firmware.\nBoot Script Service (BSS) The Boot Script Service stores the configuration information that is used to boot each hardware component. Nodes consult BSS for their boot artifacts and boot parameters when nodes boot or reboot.\nBoot Orchestration Service (BOS) The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) is responsible for booting, configuring, and shutting down collections of nodes. This is accomplished using BOS components, such as boot orchestration session templates and sessions, as well as launching a Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) that fulfills boot requests. BOS uses other services which provide boot artifact configuration (BSS), power control (CAPMC), node status (HSM), and configuration (CFS).\nCabinet Cooling Group A cabinet cooling group is a group of Olympus cabinets that are connected to a floor-standing coolant distribution unit (CDU). Management network CDU switches in the CDU aggregate all the node management network (NMN) and hardware management network (HMN) connections for the cabinet group.\nCabinet Environmental Controller (CEC) The Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet environmental controller (CEC) sets the cabinet\u0026rsquo;s geolocation, monitors environmental sensors, and communicates status to the cooling distribution unit (CDU). The CEC microcontroller (eC) signals the cooling distribution unit (CDU) to start liquid cooling and then enables the DC rectifiers so that a chassis can be powered on. The CEC does not provide a REST endpoint on SMNet, it simply provides the cabinet environmental and CDU status to the CMM for evaluation or action; the CEC takes no action. The CEC firmware is flashed automatically when the CMM firmware is flashed. If there are momentary erroneous signals because of a CEC reset or cable disconnection, the system can ride through these events without issuing an EPO.\nCEC microcontroller (eC) The CEC microcontroller (eC) sets the cabinet\u0026rsquo;s geolocation, monitors the cabinet environmental sensors, and communicates cabinet status to the cooling distribution unit (CDU). The eC does not provide a REST endpoint on SMNet as do other embedded controllers, but simply monitors the cabinet sensors and provides the cabinet environmental and CDU status to the CMMs for evaluation and/or action.\nCompute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) The Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) upgrades sets of compute nodes without requiring an entire set of nodes to be out of service at once. CRUS manages the workload management status of nodes, handling each of the steps required to upgrade compute nodes.\nSee Compute Rolling Upgrades.\nNote: CRUS is deprecated in CSM 1.2.0. It will be removed in a future CSM release and replaced with BOS V2, which will provide similar functionality.\nCray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) The Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service enables direct hardware control of power on/off, power monitoring, or system-wide power telemetry and configuration parameters from Redfish. CAPMC implements a simple interface for powering on/off compute nodes and application nodes, querying node state information, and querying site-specific service usage rules. These controls enable external software to more intelligently manage system-wide power consumption or configuration parameters.\nCray CLI (cray) The cray command line interface (CLI) is a framework created to integrate all of the system management REST APIs into easily usable commands.\nCustomer Access Network The Customer Access Network (CAN) provides access from outside the customer network to services, noncompute nodes (NCNs), and User Access Nodes (UANs) in the system. This allows for the following:\n Clients outside of the system:  Log in to each of the NCNs and UANs. Access web UIs within the system (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, and more). Access the Rest APIs within the system. Access a DNS server within the system for resolution of names for the webUI and REST API services. Run Cray CLI commands from outside the system. Access the User Access Instances (UAI).   NCNs and UANs to access systems outside the cluster (e.g. LDAP, license servers, and more). Services within the cluster to access systems outside the cluster.  These nodes and services need an IP address that routes to the customer\u0026rsquo;s network in order to be accessed from outside the network.\nChassis Management Module (CMM) The cabinet chassis management module (CMM) provides a REST endpoint via its chassis controller (cC). The CMM is an embedded controller that monitors and controls all the blades in a chassis. Each chassis supports 8 compute blades and 8 switches and associated rectifiers/PSUs in the rectifier shelf. Power Considerations - Two CMMs in adjacent chassis share power from the rectifier shelf (a shelf connects two adjacent chassis - 0 and 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7). If both CMMs sharing shelf power are both enabling the rectifiers, one of the CMMs can be removed (but only one at a time) without the rectifier shelf powering off. Removing a CMM will shutdown all compute blades and switches in the chassis. Cooling Considerations - Any single CMM in any cabinet can enable CDU cooling. Note that the CDU \u0026ldquo;enable path\u0026rdquo; has vertical control which means CMMs 0, 2, 4, and 6 and CEC0 are in a path (half of the cabinet), and CMMs 1, 3, 5, and 7 and CEC1 are in another path. Any CMM or CEC in the same half-cabinet path can be removed and CDU cooling will stay enabled as long as the other CMMs/CEC enables CDU cooling.\nCompute Node (CN) The compute node (CN) is where high performance computing application are run. These have hostnames that are of the form nidXXXXXX, that is, nid followed by six digits. where the XXXXXX is a six digit number starting with zero padding.\nConfiguration Framework Service (CFS) The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) is available on systems for remote execution and configuration management of nodes and boot images. This includes nodes available in the Hardware State Manager (HSM) service inventory (compute, management, and application nodes), and boot images hosted by the Image Management Service (IMS).\nCFS configures nodes and images via a GitOps methodology. All configuration content is stored in a version control service (VCS), and is managed by authorized system administrators. CFS provides a scalable Ansible Execution Environment (AEE) for the configuration to be applied with flexible inventory and node targeting options.\nContent Projection Service (CPS) The Content Projection Service (CPS) provides the root filesystem for compute nodes and application nodes in conjunction with the Data Virtualization Service (DVS). Using CPS and DVS, the HPE Cray Programming Environment (CPE) and Analytics products are provided as separately mounted filesystems to compute nodes, application nodes (such as UANs), and worker nodes hosting UAI pods.\nCray Site Init (CSI) The Cray Site Init (CSI) program creates, validates, installs, and upgrades an HPE Cray EX system. CSI can prepare the LiveCD for booting the PIT node and then is used from a booted PIT node to do its other functions during an installation. During an upgrade, CSI is installed on one of the nodes to facilitate the CSM software upgrade.\nCray System Management (CSM) Cray System Management (CSM) refers to the product stream which provides the infrastructure to manage an HPE Cray EX system using Kubernetes to manage the containerized workload of layered micro-services with well-defined REST APIs which provide the ability to discover and control the hardware platform, manage configuration of the system, configure the network, boot nodes, gather log and telemetry data, connect API access and user level access to Identity Providers (IdPs), and provide a method for system administrators and end-users to access the HPE Cray EX system.\nData Virtualization Service (DVS) The Data Virtualization Service (DVS) is a distributed network service that projects file systems mounted on non-compute nodes (NCN) to other nodes within the HPE Cray EX system. Projecting is the process of making a file system available on nodes where it does not physically reside. DVS-specific configuration settings enable clients to access a file system projected by DVS servers. These clients include compute nodes, User Access Nodes (UANs), and other management nodes running User Access Instances (UAIs). Thus DVS, while not a file system, represents a software layer that provides scalable transport for file system services. DVS is integrated with the Content Projection Service (CPS).\nEX Compute Cabinet A Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet is a dense compute cabinet that supports 64 compute blades and 64 high-speed network (HSN) switches.\nImage Management Service (IMS) The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from recipes. IMS also uses CFS to apply image customization for pre-boot configuration of the image root. These images are bootable on compute nodes and application nodes.\nEX TDS Cabinet A Liquid-Cooled TDS cabinet is a dense compute cabinet that supports 2-chassis, 16 compute blades and 16 high-speed network (HSN) switches, and includes a rack-mounted 4U coolant distribution unit (MCDU-4U).\nFabric The Slingshot fabric consists of the switches, cables, ports, topology policy, and configuration settings for the Slingshot high-speed network.\nFloor Standing CDU A floor-standing coolant distribution unit (CDU) pumps liquid coolant through a cabinet group or cabinet chilled doors.\nHardware Management Network (HMN) The hardware management network (HMN) includes HMS embedded controllers. This includes chassis controllers (cC), node controllers (nC) and switch controllers (sC), for Liquid-Cooled TDS and Liquid-Cooled Olympus systems. For standard rack systems, this includes iPDUs, COTS server BMCs, or any other equipment that requires hardware-management with Redfish. The hardware management network is isolated from all other node management networks. An out-of-band Ethernet management switch and hardware management VLAN is used for customer access and administration of hardware.\nHardware Management Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) The Hardware Management Notification Fanout Daemon (HMNFD) service receives component state change notifications from the HSM. It fans notifications out to subscribers (typically compute nodes).\nHardware State Manager (HSM) Hardware State Manager (HSM) service monitors and interrogates hardware components in an HPE Cray EX system, tracking hardware state and inventory information, and making it available via REST queries and message bus events when changes occur.\nHeartbeat Tracker Daemon (HBTD) The Heartbeat Tracker Daemon (HBTD) service listens for heartbeats from components (mainly compute nodes). It tracks changes in heartbeats and conveys changes to HSM.\nHigh Speed Network (HSN) The High Speed Network (HSN) in an HPE Cray EX system is based on the Slingshot switches.\nKubernetes NCNs The Kubernetes NCNs are the management nodes which are known as Kubernetes master nodes (ncn-mXXX) or Kubernetes worker nodes (ncn-wXXX). The only type of management node which is excluded from this is the utility storage node (ncn-sXXX).\nLiveCD The LiveCD has a complete bootable Linux operating system that can be run from a read-only CD or DVD, a writable USB flash drive, or a hard disk. It is used to bootstrap the installation process for CSM software. It contains the Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT). The node which boots from it during the install is known as the PIT node.\nManagement Cabinet At least one 19 inch IEA management cabinet is required for every HPE Cray EX system to support the management non-compute nodes (NCN), system management network, utility storage, and other support equipment. This cabinet serves as the primary customer access point for managing the system.\nManagement Nodes The management nodes are one grouping of NCNs. The management nodes include the master nodes with hostnames of the form of ncn-mXXX, the worker nodes with hostnames of the form ncn-wXXX, and utility storage nodes, with hostnames of the form ncn-sXXX, where the XXX is a three digit number starting with zero padding. The utility storage nodes provide Ceph storage for use by the management nodes. The master nodes provide Kubernetes master functions and have the etcd cluster which provides a datastore for Kubernetes. The worker nodes provide Kubernetes worker functions where most of the containerized workload is scheduled by Kubernetes.\nMountain Cabinet See Olympus cabinet. Some software and documentation refers to the Olympus cabinet as a Mountain cabinet.\nMountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) The Mountain Endpoint Discovery Service (MEDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation of Redfish-enabled BMCs in liquid-cooled Olympus cabinets. It periodically makes Redfish requests to determine if hardware is present or missing.\nNIC Mezzanine Card (NMC) The NIC mezzanine card (NMC) attaches to two host port connections on a liquid-cooled compute blade node card and provides the high-speed network (HSN) controllers (NICs). There are typically two or four NICs on each node card. NMCs connect to the rear panel EXAMAX connectors on the compute blade through an internal L0 cable assembly in a single-, dual-, or quad-injection bandwidth configuration depending on the design of the node card.\nNode Controller (nC) Each compute blade node card includes an embedded node controller (nC) and REST endpoint to manage the node environmental conditions, power, HMS nFPGA interface, and firmware.\nNode Management Network The node management network (NMN) communicates with motherboard PCH-style hosts, typically 10GbE Ethernet LAN-on-motherboard (LOM) interfaces. This network supports node boot protocols (DHCP/TFTP/HTTP), in-band telemetry and event exchange, and general access to management REST APIs.\nNon-Compute Node (NCN) Any node which is not a compute node may be called a Non-Compute Node (NCN). The NCNs include management nodes and application nodes.\nOlympus Cabinet The Olympus cabinet is a liquid-cooled dense compute cabinet that supports 64 compute blades and 64 high-speed network (HSN) switches. Every HPE Cray EX system with Olympus cabinets will also have at least one River cabinet to house non-compute node components such as management nodes, management network switches, storage nodes, application nodes, and possibly other air-cooled compute nodes. Some software and documentation refers to the Olympus cabinet as a Mountain cabinet.\nPower Distribution Unit (PDU) The cabinet PDU receives 480VAC 3-phase facility power and provides circuit breaker, fuse protection, and EMI filtered power to the rectifier/power supplies that distribute ±190VDC (HVDC) to a chassis. PDUs are passive devices that do not connect to the SMNet.\nPre-Install Toolkit (PIT) node The Pre-Install Toolkit is installed onto the initial node used as the inception node during software installation which is booted from a LiveCD. This is the node that will eventually become ncn-m001. The node running the Pre-Install Toolkit is known as the PIT node during the installation process until it reboots from a normal management node image like the other master nodes.\nEarly in the install process, before the Pre-Install Toolkit has been installed or booted, the documents may still refer to the PIT node. In this case, they are referring to the node which will eventually become the PIT node.\nIn this documentation, PIT node and LiveCD are sometimes used interchangeably.\nRack-Mounted CDU The rack-mounted coolant distribution unit (MCDU-4U) pumps liquid coolant through the Liquid-Cooled TDS cabinet coolant manifolds.\nRack System Compute Cabinet Air-Cooled compute cabinets house a cluster of compute nodes, Slingshot ToR switches, and SMNet ToR switches.\nRedfish Translation Service (RTS) The Redfish Translation Service (RTS) aids in management of any hardware components which are not managed by Redfish, such as a ServerTech PDU in a River Cabinet.\nRiver Cabinet At least one 19 inch IEA management cabinet is required for every HPE Cray EX system to support the management non-compute nodes (NCN), system management network, utility storage, and other support equipment. Additional River cabinets may be included to house storage storage or compute nodes which are not in an Olympus liquid-cooled cabinet.\nRiver Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) The River Endpoint Discovery Service (REDS) manages initial discovery, configuration, and geolocation of Redfish-enabled BMCs in air-cooled River cabinets. It periodically makes Redfish requests to determine if hardware is present or missing.\nRosetta ASIC The Rosetta ASIC is a 64-port switch chip that forms the foundation for the Slingshot network. Each port can operate at either 100G or 200G. Each network edge port supports IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, optimized-IP based protocols, and portals (an enhanced frame format that supports higher rates of small messages).\nService/IO Cabinet An Air-Cooled service/IO cabinet houses a cluster of NCN servers, Slingshot ToR switches, and management network ToR switches to support the managed ecosystem storage, network, user access services (UAS), and other IO services such as LNet and gateways.\nSlingshot Slingshot supports L1 and L2 network connectivity between 200 Gbs switch ports and L0 connectivity from a single 200 Gbs port to two 100 Gbs Mellanox ConnectX-5 NICs. Slingshot also supports edge ports and link aggregation groups (LAG) to external storage systems or networks.\n IEEE 802.3cd/bs (200 Gbps) Ethernet over 4 x 50 Gbs (PAM-4) lanes 200GBASE-DR4, 500 meter singlemode fiber 200GBASE-SR4, 100 meter multi-mode fiber 200GBASE-CR4, 3 meter copper cable IEEE 802.3cd (100 Gbps) Ethernet over 2 x 50 Gbs (PAM-4) lanes 100GBASE-SR2, 100 meter multimode fiber 100GBASE-CR2, 3 meter copper cable IEEE 802.3 2018 100 Gbps Ethernet over 4 x 25 Gbs (NRZ) lanes 100GBASE-CR4, 5 meter copper cable 100GBASE-SR4, 100 meter multi-mode fiber Optimized Ethernet and HPC fabric formats Lossy and lossless delivery Flow control, 802.1x (PAUSE), 802.1p (PFC), credit-based flow control on fabric links, fine-grain flow control on host links and edge ports, link-level retry, low latency FEC, Ethernet physical interfaces.  Slingshot Blade Switch The Liquid-Cooled Olympus cabinet blade switch supports one switch ASIC and 48 fabric ports. Eight connectors on the rear panel connect orthogonally to each compute blade then to NIC mezzanine cards (NMCs) inside the compute blade. Each rear panel EXAMAX connector supports two switch ports (a total of 16 fabric ports per blade). Twelve QSFP-DD cages on the front panel (4 fabric ports per QSFP-DD cage), fan out 48 external fabric ports to other switches. The front-panel top ports support passive electrical cables (PEC) or active optical cables (AOC). The front-panel bottom ports support only PECs for proper cooling in the blade enclosure.\nSlingshot Top of Rack (ToR) Switch A standard River cabinet can support one, two, or four, rack-mounted Slingshot ToR switches. Each switch supports a total of 64 fabric ports. 32 QSFP-DD connectors on the front panel connect 64 ports to the fabric. All front-panel connectors support either passive electrical cables (PEC) or active optical cables (AOC).\nShasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) The Shasta Cabling Diagram (SHCD) is a multiple tab spreadsheet prepared by HPE Cray Manufacturing with information about the components in an HPE Cray EX system. This document has much information about the system. Included in the SHCD are a configuration summary with revision history, floor layout plan, type and location of components in the air-cooled cabinets, type and location of components in the liquid-cooled cabinets, device diagrams for switches and nodes in the cabinets, list of source and destination of every HSN cable, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the spine switches, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the NMN, list of source and destination of every cable connected to the HMN. list of cabling for the KVM, and routing of power to the PDUs.\nSupply/Return Cutoff Valves Manual coolant supply and return shutoff valves at the top of each cabinet can be closed to isolate a single cabinet from the other cabinets in the cooling group for maintenance. If the valves are closed during operation, the action automatically causes the CMMs to remove ±190VDC from each chassis in the cabinet because of the loss of coolant pressure.\nSystem Admin Toolkit (SAT) The System Admin Toolkit (SAT) product provides the sat command line interface which interacts with the REST APIs of many services to perform more complex system management tasks.\nSystem Layout Service (SLS) The System Layout Service (SLS) serves as a \u0026ldquo;single source of truth\u0026rdquo; for the system design. It details the physical locations of network hardware, management nodes, application nodes, compute nodes, and cabinets. It also stores information about the network, such as which port on which switch should be connected to each node.\nSystem Management Network (SMNet) The system management network (SMNet) is a dedicated out-of-band (OOB) spine-leaf topology Ethernet network that interconnects all the nodes in the system to management services.\nSystem Management Services (SMS) System Management Services (SMS) leverages open REST APIs, Kubernetes container orchestration, and a pool of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers to manage the system. The management server pool, custom Redfish-enabled embedded controllers, iPDU controllers, and server BMCs are unified under a common software platform that provides 3 levels of management: Level 1 HaaS, Level 2 IaaS, and Level 3 PaaS.\nSystem Management Services (SMS) nodes System Management Services (SMS) nodes provide access to the entire management cluster and Kubernetes container orchestration.\nTop of Rack Switch Controller (sC-ToR) The Air-Cooled cabinet HSN ToR switch embedded controller (sC-ToR) provides a hardware management REST endpoint to monitor the ToR switch environmental conditions and manage the switch power, HSN ASIC, and FPGA interfaces.\nUser Access Instance (UAI) The User Access Instance (UAI) is a lightweight, disposable platform that runs under Kubernetes orchestration on worker nodes. The UAI provides a single user containerized environment for users on a Cray Ex system to develop, build, and execute their applications on the HPE Cray EX compute node. See UAN for another way for users to gain access.\nUser Access Node (UAN) The User Access Node (UAN) is an NCN, but is really one of the special types of application nodes. The UAN provides a traditional multi-user Linux environment for users on a Cray Ex system to develop, build, and execute their applications on the HPE Cray EX compute node. See UAI for another way for users to gain access. Some sites refer to their UANs as Login nodes.\nUser Access Service (UAS) The User Access Service (UAS) is a containerized service managed by Kubernetes that enables users to create and run user applications inside a UAI. UAS runs on a management node that is acting as a Kubernetes worker node. When a user requests a new UAI, the UAS service returns status and connection information to the newly created UAI. External access to UAS is routed through a node that hosts gateway services.\nVersion Control Service (VCS) The Version Control Service (VCS) provides configuration content to CFS via a GitOps methodology based on a git server (gitea) that can be accessed by the git command but also includes a web interface for repository management, pull requests, and a visual view of all repositories and organizations.\nxname Component names (xnames) identify the geolocation for hardware components in the HPE Cray EX system. Every component is uniquely identified by these component names. Some, like the system cabinet number or the CDU number, can be changed by site needs. There is no geolocation encoded within the cabinet number, such as an X-Y coordinate system to relate to the floor layout of the cabinets. Other component names refer to the location within a cabinet and go down to the port on a card or switch or the socket holding a processor or a memory DIMM location. See Component Names (xnames).\n"

This page outlines reference information for these disks, their partition tables, and their management.\nTopics:  What Controls Partitioning?

Partitioning is controlled by two aspects:\n dracut; this selects disks and builds their partition tables and/or LVM storage. cloud-init; this manages standalone partitions or volumes, as well as high-level object storage.  Plan of Record / Baseline    Node Type No. of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disks (0.5 TiB) No. of \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; disks (1.9 TiB)     k8s-master nodes 3 0   k8s-worker nodes 2 1   ceph-storage nodes 2 3+    Disks are chosen by dracut. Kubernetes and storage nodes use different dracut modules.\n First, two disks for the OS are chosen from the pool of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disks Second, one disk is selected for the ephemeral data  Problems When Above/Below Baseline The master nodes and worker nodes use the same artifacts, and thus have the same dracut modules assimilating disks. Therefore, it is important to beware of:\n k8s-master nodes with one or more extra \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; disk(s); these disks help but are unnecessary ceph-storage nodes do not run the same dracut modules because they have different disk demands  Worker Nodes with ETCD k8s-worker nodes with 1 or more extra \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disk(s); these disks are confusing and unnecessary and can be disabled easily.\nDisable Luks  NOTE This is broken, use the expand RAID option instead. (MTL-1309)\n All NCNs (master/worker/storage) have the same kernel parameters, but are not always necessary. This method works by toggling the dependency for the metal ETCD module, disabling LUKs will disable ETCD bare-metal creation.\n  Disable LUKs for each worker node, thus disabling the metal ETCD module:\n During Bootstrap (on the pit node): sed -i \u0026#39;s/disk-opts rd.luks /disk-opts rd.luks=0 /g\u0026#39; /var/www/ncn-w*/script.ipxe  During runtime with csi: csi handoff bss-update-param rd.luks=0     Rebuild the node\n Run the basic wipe if the node was already booted (re)boot the node    Expand the RAID This option simply expands the RAID to consume the extra disks, leaving none behind for the metal ETCD module to find.\n  Set metal.disks equal to the number of \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; disks in the node(s), this will reserve them for the RAID and prevent any other partitioning from happening on them.\n During Bootstrap (on the pit node): sed -i \u0026#39;s/disk-opts /disk-opts metal.disks=3 /g\u0026#39; /var/www/ncn-w*/script.ipxe  During runtime with csi: csi handoff bss-update-param metal.disks=3     Change the RAID type, or leave it as default (mirror)\n During Bootstrap (on the pit node): sed -i \u0026#39;s/disk-opts /disk-opts metal.md-level=stripe /g\u0026#39; /var/www/ncn-w*/script.ipxe  During runtime with csi: csi handoff bss-update-param metal.md-level=stripe     Rebuild the node\n Run the basic wipe if the node was already booted (re)boot the node    Disk Layout Quick-Reference Tables The table below represents all recognizable FS labels on any given management node, varying slightly by node role (Kubernetes master or Kubernetes worker).\n   k8s-master k8s-worker storage-ceph FS Label Partitions Device Partition Size OverlayFS Memo      ✅ ✅ ✅ BOOTRAID /metal/recovery 2 small disks in RAID1 500 MiB ❌     ✅ ✅ ✅ SQFSRAID /run/initramfs/live 2 small disks in RAID1 25 GiB ✅ squashfs should compress our images to about 1/3rd their uncompressed size.

These enable two critical functions; changes to data and new data will persist between reboots, and RAM (memory) is freed because we are using our block-devices (SATA/PCIe).\n ROOTRAID is the persistent root overlayFS, it commits and saves all changes made to the running OS and it stands on a RAID1 mirror. CONLIB is a persistent overlayFS for containerd, it commits and saves all new changes while allowing read-through to pre-existing (baked-in) data from the squashFS. ETCDK8S is a persistent overlayFS for etcd, it works like the CONLIB overlayFS however this exists in an encrypted LUKS2 partition.  OverlayFS Example  Helpful commands\u0026hellip; the overlayFS organization can be best viewed with these three commands:\n lsblk, lsblk -f will show how the RAIDs and disks are mounted losetup -a will show where the squashFS is mounted from mount | grep ' / ' will show you the overlay being layered atop the squashFS   Let us pick apart the SQFSRAID and ROOTRAID overlays.\n /run/rootfsbase is the SquashFS image itself /run/initramfs/live is the squashFS\u0026rsquo;s storage array, where one or more squashFS can live /run/initramfs/overlayfs is the overlayFS storage array, where the persistent directories live /run/overlayfs and /run/ovlwork are symlinks to `/run/initramfs/overlayfs/overlayfs-SQFSRAID-$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/disk/by-label/SQFSRAID) and the neighboring work directory Admin note: The \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; directory is where the operating system processes data. It is the interim where data passes between RAM and persistent storage.  Using the above bullets, one may be able to better understand the machine output below:\nncn-m002# mount | grep \u0026#39; / \u0026#39; LiveOS_rootfs on / type overlay (rw,relatime,lowerdir=/run/rootfsbase,upperdir=/run/overlayfs,workdir=/run/ovlwork) ^^^R/O^SQUASHFS IMAGE^^^|^^^ R/W PERSISTENCE ^^^|^^^^^^INTERIM^^^^^^ ^^^R/O^SQUASHFS IMAGE^^^|^^^ R/W PERSISTENCE ^^^|^^^^^^INTERIM^^^^^^ ^^^R/O^SQUASHFS IMAGE^^^|^^^ R/W PERSISTENCE ^^^|^^^^^^INTERIM^^^^^^ ncn-m002# losetup -a /dev/loop1: [0025]:74858 (/run/initramfs/thin-overlay/meta) /dev/loop2: [0025]:74859 (/run/initramfs/thin-overlay/data) /dev/loop0: [2430]:100 (/run/initramfs/live/LiveOS/filesystem.squashfs)  The THIN OVERLAY is the transient space the system uses behind the scenes to allow data to live in RAM as it is written to disk. The THIN part of the overlay is the magic, using THIN overlays means the kernel will automatically clear free blocks.\n Below is the layout of what a persistent system looks like. Note, this means that persistent capacity is there, but administrators should beware of reset toggles on unfamiliar systems. There are toggles to reset overlays that are, by default, toggled off (so data persistence be default is safe but one should not assume).\nncn-m002# lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT loop0 7:0 0 3.8G 1 loop /run/rootfsbase loop1 7:1 0 30G 0 loop └─live-overlay-pool 254:2 0 300G 0 dm loop2 7:2 0 300G 0 loop └─live-overlay-pool 254:2 0 300G 0 dm sda 8:0 1 447.1G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 1 476M 0 part │ └─md127 9:127 0 476M 0 raid1 ├─sda2 8:2 1 92.7G 0 part │ └─md126 9:126 0 92.6G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/live └─sda3 8:3 1 279.4G 0 part └─md125 9:125 0 279.3G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/overlayfs sdb 8:16 1 447.1G 0 disk ├─sdb1 8:17 1 476M 0 part │ └─md127 9:127 0 476M 0 raid1 ├─sdb2 8:18 1 92.7G 0 part │ └─md126 9:126 0 92.6G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/live └─sdb3 8:19 1 279.4G 0 part └─md125 9:125 0 279.3G 0 raid1 /run/initramfs/overlayfs sdc 8:32 1 447.1G 0 disk └─ETCDLVM 254:0 0 447.1G 0 crypt └─etcdvg0-ETCDK8S 254:1 0 32G 0 lvm /run/lib-etcd Persistent Directories Not all directories are persistent!\nOnly the following directories are persistent by default:\n etc home root srv tmp var /run/containerd /run/lib-containerd /run/lib-etcd /run/lib/kubelet  More directories can be added, but mileage varies.

The upper layer is the OverlayFS, read-write, which does a bit-wise xor with the lower-layer Anything in the upper-layer takes precedence by default.   There are fancier options for overlays, such as multiple lower-layers, copy-up (lower-layer precedence), and opaque (removing a directory in the upper layer hides it in the lower layer). You can read more [here|https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html#inode-properties]\n Layering Real World Example Let us take /root for example, we can see in the upper-dir (the overlay) we have these files:\nThe upper-dir has these files:\nncn-m001# ls -l /run/overlayfs/root/ total 4 -rw------- 1 root root 252 Nov 4 18:23 .bash_history drwxr-x--- 4 root root 37 Nov 4 04:35 .kube drwx------ 2 root root 29 Oct 21 21:57 .ssh Then in the squashFS image (lower-dir) we have these\u0026hellip;\nncn-m001# ls -l /run/rootfsbase/root/ total 1 -rw------- 1 root root 0 Oct 19 15:31 .bash_history drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 3 May 25 2018 bin drwx------ 3 root root 26 Oct 21 22:07 .cache drwx------ 2 root root 3 May 25 2018 .gnupg drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 57 Oct 19 15:23 inst-sys drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 33 Oct 19 15:33 .kbd drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 53 Oct 19 15:34 spire drwx------ 2 root root 70 Oct 21 21:57 .ssh -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 172 Oct 26 15:25 .wget-hsts  Notice how the .bash_history file in the lower-dir is 0 bytes, but it is 252 bytes in the upperdir?

The take-away here is: any change done to /root/ will persist through /run/overlayfs/root and will take precedence to the squashFS image root.\nOverlayFS Control These features or toggles are passable on the kernel command line, and change the behavior of the overlayFS.\nReset Toggles The overlay FS provides a few reset toggles to clear out the persistence directories without reinstall.\nThe toggles require rebooting.\nReset On Next Boot The preferred way to reset persistent storage is to use the overlayFS reset toggle.\nModify the boot command line on the PXE server, adding this\n# Reset the overlay on boot rd.live.overlay.reset=1 Once reset, you may want to enable persistence again. Simply revert your change and the next reboot will persist.\n# Cease resetting the overlayFS rd.live.overlay.reset=0 Reset on Every Boot There are two options one can leave enabled to accomplish this:\n rd.live.overlay.reset=1 will eradicate/recreate the overlay every reboot. rd.live.overlay.readonly=1 will clear the overlay on every reboot.  For long-term usage, rd.live.overlay.readonly=1 should be added to the command line.\nThe reset=1 toggle is usually used to fix a problematic overlay. If you want to refresh and purge the overlay completely, then use rd.live.overlay.reset.\n# Authorize METAL to purge metal.no-wipe=0 rd.live.overlay.reset=1  Note: metal.no-wipe=1 does not protect against rd.live.overlay.reset, metal.no-wipe is not a feature of dmsquash-live.\n Re-sizing the Persistent Overlay  Default Size: 300 GiB File System: XFS  The overlay can be resized to fit a variety of needs or use cases. The size is provided directly on the command line. Any value can be provided, but it must be in megabytes.\nIf you are resetting the overlay on a deployed node, you will need to also set rd.live.overlay.reset=1.\nIt is recommended to set the size before deployment. There is a linkage between the metal-dracut module and the live-module that makes this inflexible.\n# Use a 300 GiB overlayFS (default) rd.live.overlay.size=307200 # Use a 1 TiB overlayFS rd.live.overlay.size=1000000 Thin Overlay Feature The persistent overlayFS leverages newer, \u0026ldquo;thin\u0026rdquo; overlays that support discards and that will free blocks that are not claimed by the file system. This means that memory is free/released when the file system does not claim it anymore.\nThin overlays can be disabled, and instead classic DM Snapshots can be used to manage the overlay. This will use more RAM. It is not recommended, because dmraid is not included in the initrd.\n# Enable (default) rd.live.overlay.thin=1 # Disable (not recommended; undesirable RAM waste) rd.live.overlay.thin=0 SystemD MetalFS The metalfs systemd service will try to mount any metal created partitions.\nThis runs against the /run/initramfs/overlayfs/fstab.metal when it exists. This file is dynamically created by most metal dracut modules.\nThe service will continuously attempt to mount the partitions, if problems arise please stop the service:\nncn# systemctl stop metalfs Old/Retired FS-Labels Deprecated FS labels/partitions from Shasta 1.3.X (no longer in Shasta 1.4.0 and onwards).\n   FS Label Partitions Nodes Device Size on Disk Memo      K8SKUBE /var/lib/kubelet ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral Max/Remainder No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4    K8SEPH /var/lib/cray/k8s_ephemeral ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral Max/Remainder No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4    CRAYINSTALL /var/cray/vfat ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral 12 GiB No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4    CRAYVBIS /var/cray/vbis ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral 900 GiB No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4    CRAYNFS /var/lib/nfsroot/nmd ncn-w001, ncn-w002 Ephemeral 12 GiB No longer mounted/used in shasta-1.4     "

Outside of a new installation, there is no supported method to rotate or change the platform CA in this release.\nTopics:  Overview Use Default Platform Generated CA Customize Platform Generated CA Use External CA  Overview At install time, a PKI certificate authority (CA) can either be generated for a system, or a customer can opt to supply their own (intermediate) CA.\n Outside of a new installation, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n Sealed Secrets, part of shasta-cfg, are used by the installation process to inject CA material in an encrypted form. Vault (cray-vault instance) ultimately sources and stores the CA from a K8S secret (result of decrypting the corresponding Sealed Secret).\nThe resulting CA will be used to sign multiple workloads on the platform (Ingress, mTLS for PostgreSQL Clusters, Spire, \u0026hellip;).\n Management of Sealed Secrets should ideally take place on a secure workstation.\n Use Default Platform Generated CA In shasta-cfg, there is a Sealed Secret generator named platform_ca. By default, the customizations.yaml file will contain a generation template to use this generator, and will create a sealed secret named generated-platform-ca-1. The cray-vault overrides in customizations.yaml contain a) a templated reference to expand the generated-platform-ca-1 Sealed Secret and b) directives instructing vault to load the CA material on start-up \u0026ndash; ultimately initializing a HashiCorp Vault PKI Engine instance with the material.\n Note: the intermediate CA gets installed into Vault, not the root CA (as generated). Use of a root CA is not recommended.\n The resulting default configuration (prior to seeding customizations) should look like the following customizations.yaml snippet:\nspec: ... kubernetes: sealed_secrets: ... gen_platform_ca_1: generate: name: generated-platform-ca-1 data: - type: platform_ca args: root_days: 3651 int_days: 3650 root_cn: \u0026#34;Platform CA\u0026#34; int_cn: \u0026#34;Platform CA - L1\u0026#34; services: ... cray-vault: sealedSecrets: - \u0026#34;{{ kubernetes.sealed_secrets.gen_platform_ca_1 | toYaml }}\u0026#34; pki: customCA: enabled: true secret: generated-platform-ca-1 private_key: int_ca.key certificate: int_ca.crt ca_bundle: root_ca.crt ...  The platform_ca generator will produce RSA CAs with a 3072-bit modulus, using SHA256 as the base signature algorithm.\n Customize Platform Generated CA The platform_ca generator inputs can be customized, if desired. Notably, the root_days, int_days, root_cn, and int_cn fields can be modified. While the shasta-cfg documentation on the use of generators supplies additional detail, the *_days settings control the validity period and the *_cn settings control the common name value for the resulting CA certificates. Ensure the Sealed Secret name reference in spec.kubernetes.services.cray-vault.sealedSecrets is updated if you opt to use a different name.\n Outside of a new installation, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. Please set validity periods accordingly. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n Use External CA The static_platform_ca generator, part of shasta-cfg, can be used to supply an external CA private key, certificate, and associated upstream CAs that form the trust chain. The generator will attempt to prevent you from supplying a root CA. You must also supply the entire trust chain up to the root CA certificate.\n Outside of a new installation, there is currently no supported method to rotate (change) the platform CA. Please ensure validity periods are set accordingly for external CAs you use in this process. The ability to rotate CAs is anticipated as part of a future release.\n Here is an example customizations.yaml snippet illustrating the generator input to inject a static CA:\nspec: ... kubernetes:

	"content": "Cray System Management (CSM) - README The documentation included here describes how to install or upgrade the Cray System Management (CSM) software and related supporting operational procedures. CSM software is the foundation upon which other software product streams for the HPE Cray EX system depend.\nThis documentation is in Markdown format. Although much of it can be viewed with any text editor, a richer experience will come from using a tool which can render the Markdown to show different font sizes, the use of bold and italics formatting, inclusion of diagrams and screen shots as image files, and to follow navigational links within a topic file and to other files.\nThere are many tools which can render the Markdown format to get these advantages. Any Internet search for Markdown tools will provide a long list of these tools. Some of the tools are better than others at displaying the images and allowing you to follow the navigational links.\nThe exploration of the CSM documentation begins with the Cray System Management Documentation which introduces topics related to CSM software installation, upgrade, and operational use. Notice that the previous sentence had a link to the file for the Cray System Management Documentation. If the link does not work, then a better Markdown viewer is needed.\n"

Fixes an issue preventing SCSD changing root credentials for DL325/385. Fixes an intermittent issue where Gigabyte firmware updates via FAS would return an error. Fixes a rare issue where Nexus would not be available when scaling down to two nodes. Fixes an issue where the boot order for Gigabyte NCNs was not persisting after a reboot or reinstall. Fixes an intermittent issue where storage nodes would have clock skew during fresh install.  CSM 1.0.1 The following lists enumerate major improvements since CSM v0.9.x.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s New   Functionality\n Scale up to 6000 Nodes is supported.  Conman has been updated to using a deployment model that handles a larger scale. Additional scaling improvements have been incorporated into several services including, Unbound, Kea, hardware state manager (HSM), and Spire.   Upgrades between major versions are now allowed. The CSM installation process has been improved.  Over 20 workarounds from the prior CSM release have been removed. A significant number of installation-related enhancements have been integrated, both functionally and thru documentation. Installation validation testing has been improved by updating existing validation tests and also adding additional tests.      Enhanced Documentation\n CSM operational documentation has been changed to markdown format for standardized deployment. CSM Administration Guides and Operational Procedures are now also available online. Searchable HTML - https://cray-hpe.github.io/docs-csm/en-10/ Source - https://github.com/Cray-HPE/docs-csm/tree/release/1.0 Improvements have been made to the documentation regarding installation, operations, and troubleshooting.

A significant number of security enhancements have been implemented to eliminate vulnerabilities and provide security hardening Including: - The removal of clear-text passwords in CSM install scripts - Incorporation of trusted-base operating systems in containers - And addresses many critical security CVEs.    Customer Requested Enhancements\n Error Logging for the BOS session template must be improved. IMS must provide a way to clean up sessions without the use of jq and xargs. Cray-cfs-batcher needs a maximum limit for session creation suspension. BOS session should help to identify the resulting cfs job. DHCP lease time should be increased. (It was increased to 3600 seconds.) Helm charts should have a way to be automatically patched during Shasta installation. HSM should add a timestamp to State Change Notifications (SCN) data before publishing to Kafka topic: cray-hmsstatechange-notifications. End-of-Life Alpine and nginx container images must be removed for security purposes. CAPMC simulates reinit on hardware that does not support restart; see CAPMC reinit and configuration for more information    Bug Fixes The following list enumerates the more important issues that were found and fixed in CSM v1.0.1. In total, there were more than 34 customer-reported issues and more than 350 development critical issues fixed in this release.\nCritical Issues Resolved:\n Prometheus cannot scrape kubelet/kube-proxy. CFS can run layers out of order. The cray-bss - bos session boot parameter update seems slow. Compute nodes fail to PXE boot and drop into the EFI shell. The ncn-personalization of ncn-m002 and m003 seems to be in endless loop. FAS is claiming to have worked on CMM, but it did not during a V1.4 install. The cray-hbtd is reporting \u0026ldquo;Telemetry bus not accepting messages, heartbeat event not sent.\u0026rdquo; When talking to SMD, Commands are failing with an Err 503. The command \u0026ldquo;cray hsm inventory ethernetInterfaces update \u0026ndash;component-id\u0026rdquo; is rejected as invalid. There is a high rate of failed DNS queries being forwarded off-system by unbound. NCN worker node\u0026rsquo;s HSN connection is not being renamed to hsn0 or hsn1. During large-scale node boots, a small number of nodes are stuck with fetching auth token failed. Zypper install is broken because it tries to talk to suse.com. Node exporters failed to parse mountinfo and are not running on ncn-s0xx nodes. The cfs-hwsync-agent is repeatedly dying with RC=137 due to an OOM issue. The gitea pvc is unavailable following a full system cold reboot. sysmgmt-health references docker.io/jimmidyson/configmap-reload:v0.3.0, which cannot be loaded. Upstream NTP is not appearing in the chronyd config. Incorrect packaged firmware metadata is being reported by FAS for the NCN\u0026rsquo;s iLO/BIOS. At scale, there is a DNS slowdown when attempting to reboot all of the nodes, causing DNS lookup failures. cray-sysmgmt-health-kube-state-metrics uses an image of kube-state-metrics:v1.9.6, which contains a bug that causes alerts. CFS teardown reports swapped image results. The unbound DNS manager job is not functioning, so compute nodes cannot be reached. The Keycloak service crashed because it was out of java heap space. Unbound should not forward to site DNS for Shasta zones. k8s Pod Priority Support needs to be in k8s Image. CFS is running multiple sessions for the same nodes at the same time. The CFS CLI does not allow tags on session create. CFS should check if the configuration is valid/exists when a session is created. CFS does not set session start time until after job starts. CFS will not list pending sessions. MEDS, should not overwrite a components credentials when an xname becomes present again. The Cray HSM locks command locked more nodes than specified. HSM crashes when discovering Bard Peak. Resources limits are hit on three NCN systems. Conman is unable to connect to compute consoles. For better reliability, the orphan stratum in Chrony config needed to be adjusted. The UEFI Boot Order Reverts/Restores on every reboot on an HPE DL325. and many more\u0026hellip;  Known Issues  Incorrect_output_for_bos_command_rerun: When a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session fails, it may output a message in the Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) log associated with that session. This output contains a command that instructs the user how to re-run the failed session. It will only contain the nodes that failed during that session. The command is faulty, and this issue addresses correcting it. Cfs_session_stuck_in_pending: Under some circumstances, Configuration Framework Service (CFS) sessions can get stuck in a pending state, never completing and potentially blocking other sessions. This addresses cleaning up those sessions. The branch parameter in CFS configurations may not work, and setting it will instead return an error. Continue setting the git commit hash instead. After a boot or reboot a few CFS Pods may continue running even after they have finished and never go away. For more information see Orphaned CFS Pods After Booting or Rebooting. Intermittently, kernel dumps do not deliver because the CA cert for Spire needed to be reset. Intermittently, PXE booting of NCNs time out. Intermittently, Console replays output. FAS loader is not handling the new Slingshot 1.6 firmware update because of its new version scheme. Ceph services do not auto-start after a reboot of a storage node. Intermittently, ssh connections to Ceph show host key verification errors. Intermittently, DNS requests briefly fail during hardware discovery or an upgrade. SCSD is not able to change root credentials for DL325/385 due to a bug in the 11.2021 iLO firmware. Intermittently, Gigabyte firmware updates via FAS show an error. Rarely, Nexus is not available when scaling down NCN workers to two nodes. The boot order for Gigabyte NCNs does not persist after a reboot or reinstall. Intermittently, storage nodes have clock skew during fresh install. Kube-multus pods may fail to restart due to ImagePullBackOff. For more information see Kube-multus pod is in ImagePullBackOff. Power capping Olympus and River compute hardware via CAPMC is not supported. On fresh install, API calls to Gitea/VCS may give 401 Errors. See Gitea/VCS 401 Errors for more information. Console logging may fill all available space for console log files. See Console logs filling up availble storage for more information.  "

Having PXE first and disk as a fallback works in the majority of situations.\nIt may be desirable to change the boot order under these circumstances:\n Testing disk-backed booting Booting from a USB or remote ISO Testing or deploying other customizations  Determine if NCNs booted via disk or PXE There are two different methods for determining whether a management node is booted using disk or PXE. The method to use will vary depending on the system environment.\n  Check kernel parameters.\nncn# cat /proc/cmdline If it starts with kernel then the node network booted.

The /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases file is checked when setting up the symlinks for the artifacts each node needs to boot. So if the BMCs are set to static, those artifacts will not get set up correctly. Set the BMCs back to DHCP by using a command such as:\n read -s is used to prevent the password from being written to the screen or the shell history.\n ncn# USERNAME=root ncn# read -s IPMI_PASSWORD ncn# export IPMI_PASSWORD ncn# for h in $( grep mgmt /etc/hosts | grep -v m001 | awk -F \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; ); do ipmitool -U $USERNAME -I lanplus -H $h -E lan set 1 ipsrc dhcp done Some BMCs need a cold reset in order to pick up this change fully:\nncn# for h in $( grep mgmt /etc/hosts | grep -v m001 | awk -F \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; ); do ipmitool -U $USERNAME -I lanplus -H $h -E mc reset cold done Boot order overview  ipmitool can set and edit boot order; it works better for some vendors based on their BMC implementation efibootmgr speaks directly to the node\u0026rsquo;s UEFI; it can only be ignored by new BIOS activity   NOTE: cloud-init will set boot order when it runs, but this does not always work with certain hardware vendors. An administrator can invoke the cloud-init script at /srv/cray/scripts/metal/set-efi-bbs.sh on any NCN. Find the script here, on GitHub.\n Setting boot order This section gives the procedure for setting the boot order on NCNs and the PIT node.\nSetting the boot order with efibootmgr will ensure that the desired network interfaces and disks are in the proper order for booting.\nThe commands are the same for all hardware vendors, except where noted.\n  Create a list of the desired IPv4 boot devices.\nFollow the section corresponding to the hardware manufacturer of the system:\n  Gigabyte Technology\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -iP \u0026#39;(pxe ipv?4.*adapter)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/bbs1   Hewlett-Packard Enterprise\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i \u0026#39;port 1\u0026#39; | grep -i \u0026#39;pxe ipv4\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/bbs1   Intel Corporation\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i \u0026#39;ipv4\u0026#39; | grep -iv \u0026#39;baseboard\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/bbs1     Create a list of the Cray disk boot devices.\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep cray | tee /tmp/bbs2   Set the boot order to first PXE boot, with disk boot as the fallback option.\nncn/pit# efibootmgr -o $(cat /tmp/bbs* | awk \u0026#39;!x[$0]++\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/^Boot//g\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39; | tr -t \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/,$//\u0026#39;) | grep -i bootorder   Set all of the desired boot options to be active.\nncn/pit# cat /tmp/bbs* | awk \u0026#39;!x[$0]++\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/^Boot//g\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39; | xargs -r -t -i efibootmgr -b {} -a   After following the steps above on a given NCN, that NCN will use the desired Shasta boot order.\nThis is the end of the Setting boot order procedure.\nTrimming boot order This section gives the procedure for removing unwanted entries from the boot order on NCNs and the PIT node.\nThis section will only advise on removing other PXE entries. There are too many vendor-specific entries beyond disks and NICs to cover in this section (e.g. BIOS entries, iLO entries, etc.).\nIn this case, the instructions are the same regardless of node type (management, storage, or worker):\n  Make lists of the unwanted boot entries.\n  Gigabyte Technology\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -ivP \u0026#39;(pxe ipv?4.*)\u0026#39; | grep -iP \u0026#39;(adapter|connection|nvme|sata)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/rbbs1 ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -iP \u0026#39;(pxe ipv?4.*)\u0026#39; | grep -i connection | tee /tmp/rbbs2   Hewlett-Packard Enterprise\n NOTE: This does not trim HSN Mellanox cards; these should disable their OpROMs using the high speed network snippets.\n ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -vi \u0026#39;pxe ipv4\u0026#39; | grep -i adapter |tee /tmp/rbbs1 ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -iP \u0026#39;(sata|nvme)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/rbbs2   Intel Corporation\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -vi \u0026#39;ipv4\u0026#39; | grep -iP \u0026#39;(sata|nvme|uefi)\u0026#39; | tee /tmp/rbbs1 ncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i baseboard | tee /tmp/rbbs2     Remove them.\nncn/pit# cat /tmp/rbbs* | awk \u0026#39;!x[$0]++\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/^Boot//g\u0026#39; | awk \u0026#39;{print $1}\u0026#39; | tr -d \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; | xargs -r -t -i efibootmgr -b {} -B   The boot menu should be trimmed down to contain only relevant entries.\nThis is the end of the Trimming boot order procedure.\nExample boot orders Each section shows example output of the efibootmgr command.\n  Master node (with onboard NICs enabled)\nBootCurrent: 0009 Timeout: 2 seconds BootOrder: 0004,0000,0007,0009,000B,000D,0012,0013,0002,0003,0001 Boot0000* cray (sda1) Boot0001* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell Boot0002* UEFI OS Boot0003* UEFI OS Boot0004* cray (sdb1) Boot0007* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0009* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:62 Boot000B* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:63 Boot000D* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0012* UEFI: PNY USB 3.1 FD PMAP Boot0013* UEFI: PNY USB 3.1 FD PMAP, Partition 2   Storage node (with onboard NICs enabled)\nBootNext: 0005 BootCurrent: 0006 Timeout: 2 seconds BootOrder: 0007,0009,0000,0002 Boot0000* cray (sda1) Boot0001* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell Boot0002* cray (sdb1) Boot0005* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0007* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:88:76 Boot0009* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:88:77 Boot000B* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection   Worker node (with onboard NICs enabled)\nBootNext: 0005 BootCurrent: 0008 Timeout: 2 seconds BootOrder: 0007,0009,000B,0000,0002 Boot0000* cray (sda1) Boot0001* UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell Boot0002* cray (sdb1) Boot0005* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection Boot0007* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - 98:03:9B:AA:88:30 Boot0009* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:2A Boot000B* UEFI: PXE IP4 Mellanox Network Adapter - B8:59:9F:34:89:2B Boot000D* UEFI: PXE IP4 Intel(R) I350 Gigabit Network Connection   Reverting changes This procedure is only needed if wishing to revert boot order changes.\nReset the BIOS.

Tools such as lsblk, blkid, or kernel (/proc) may also be of use. As an example, one can sometimes match up ls -l /dev/disk/by-partuuid with efibootmgr -v.\n  Display the current UEFI boot selections.\nncn/pit# efibootmgr Example output:\nBootCurrent: 0015 Timeout: 1 seconds BootOrder: 000E,000D,0011,0012,0007,0005,0006,0008,0009,0000,0001,0002,000A,000B,000C,0003,0004,000F,0010,0013,0014 Boot0000* Enter Setup Boot0001 Boot Device List Boot0002 Network Boot Boot0003* Launch EFI Shell Boot0004* UEFI HTTPv6: Network 00 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot0005* UEFI HTTPv6: Intel Network 00 at Baseboard Boot0006* UEFI HTTPv4: Intel Network 00 at Baseboard Boot0007* UEFI IPv4: Intel Network 00 at Baseboard Boot0008* UEFI IPv6: Intel Network 00 at Baseboard Boot0009* UEFI HTTPv6: Intel Network 01 at Baseboard Boot000A* UEFI HTTPv4: Intel Network 01 at Baseboard Boot000B* UEFI IPv4: Intel Network 01 at Baseboard Boot000C* UEFI IPv6: Intel Network 01 at Baseboard Boot000D* UEFI HTTPv4: Network 00 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot000E* UEFI IPv4: Network 00 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot000F* UEFI IPv6: Network 00 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot0010* UEFI HTTPv6: Network 01 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot0011* UEFI HTTPv4: Network 01 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot0012* UEFI IPv4: Network 01 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot0013* UEFI IPv6: Network 01 at Riser 02 Slot 01 Boot0014* UEFI Samsung Flash Drive 1100 Boot0015* UEFI Samsung Flash Drive 1100 Boot0018* UEFI SAMSUNG MZ7LH480HAHQ-00005 S45PNA0M838871 Boot1001* Enter Setup   Set next boot entry.\nIn the example above, the device is 0014 or 0015. An option is to guess it is the first one, and can correct this on-the-fly in POST. Notice the lack of Boot in the ID number given; If wanting to choose Boot0014 in the output above, pass 0014 to efibootmgr:\nncn/pit# efibootmgr -n 0014   Verify that the BootNext device is what was selected.\nncn/pit# efibootmgr | grep -i bootnext Example output:\nBootNext: 0014   Now the UEFI Samsung Flash Drive will boot next.\n NOTE: There are duplicates in the list. During boot, the EFI boot manager will select the first one. If the first one is false, then it can be deleted with efibootmgr -b 0014 -d.\n   This is the end of the Locating USB device procedure.\n"

	"content": "Non-Compute Node BIOS This page denotes BIOS settings that are desirable for non-compute nodes.\n NOTE Any tunables in this page are in the interest of performance and stability. If either of those facets seem to be infringed by any of the content on this page, please contact Cray System Management for reconciliation.\n  NOTE The table below declares desired settings; unlisted settings should remain at vendor-default. This table may be expanded as new settings are adjusted.\n    Common Name Common Value Description Value Rationale Common Menu Location     Intel® Hyper-Threading (e.g. HT) Enabled Enables two-threads per physical core. Leverage the full performance of the CPU, the higher thread-count assists with parallel tasks within the processor(s). Within the Processor or the PCH Menu.   Intel® Virtualization Technology (e.g. VT-x, VT) and AMD Virtualization Technology (e.g. AMD-V) Enabled Enables Virtual Machine extensions. Provides added CPU support for hypervisors and more for the virtualized plane within Shasta. Within the Processor or the PCH Menu.   PXE Retry Count 1 or 2 (default: 1) Attempts done on a single boot-menu option (note: 2 should be set for systems with unsolved network congestion). If networking is working nominally, then the interface either works or does not. Retrying the same NIC should not work, if it does then there are networking problems that need to be addressed. Within the Networking Menu, and then under Network Boot.   PXE Timeout 5 Seconds (or less, never more) The time that the PXE ROM will wait for a DHCP handshake to complete before moving on to the next boot device. If DHCP is working nominally, then the DHCP handshake should not take longer than 5 seconds. This timeout could be increased where networking faults cannot be reconciled, but ideally this should be tuned to 3 or 2 seconds.    Continuous Boot Disabled Whether boot-group (e.g. all network devices, or all disk devices) should continuously retry. This prevents fall-through to the fallback disks. We want deterministic nodes in Shasta, if the boot fails the first tier we want the node to try the next tier of boot mediums before failing at a shell or menu for intervention.      NOTE PCIe options can be found in PCIe : Setting Expected Values.\n "
