      <description>Change Java Security Settings If Java will not allow a connection to an Intel nodes via SOL or iKVM, change Java security settings to add an exception for the nodes&amp;rsquo;s BMC IP address.
The Intel nodes ship with an insecure certificate, which causes an exception for Java when trying to connect via SOL or iKVM to these nodes. The workaround is to add the node&amp;rsquo;s BMC IP address to the Exception Site List in the Java Control Panel of the machine attempting to connect to the Intel node.</description>

      <description>Change Settings for HMS Collector Polling of Air-Cooled Nodes The cray-hms-hmcollector service polls all air-cooled hardware to gather the necessary telemetry information for use by other services, such as the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) service. This polling occurs every 10 seconds on a continual basis. Instabilities with the AMI Redfish implementation in the Gigabyte BMCs require a less significant approach when gathering power and temperature telemetry data. If the BMCs are overloaded, they can become unresponsive, return incorrect data, or encounter other errors.</description>

      <description>Change Settings in the Bond iPXE is used to setup udev rules for interface names and bond members. The configuration of these are dynamic on boot until node customization runs (cloud-init) and sets up the conventional /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-bond0 and other neighboring files.
The initial settings of the bonds can be changed directly in the LiveCD or with the Boot Script Service (BSS). When cabling is different than normal, there is flexibility for customizing bond links.</description>

      <description>Check the BMC Failover Mode Gigabyte BMCs must have their failover mode disabled to prevent incorrect network assignment.
If Gigabyte BMC failover mode is not disabled, then some BMCs may receive incorrect IP addresses. Specifically, a BMC may request an IP address on the wrong subnet and be unable to re-acquire a new IP address on the correct subnet. If this occurs, administrators should ensure that the impacted BMC has its failover feature disabled.</description>

      <guid>/docs-csm/en-10/operations/node_management/configuration_of_ncn_bonding/</guid>
      <description>Configuration of NCN Bonding Non-compute nodes (NCNs) have network interface controllers (NICs) connected to the management network that are configured in a redundant manner via Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) link aggregation. The link aggregation configuration can be modified by editing and applying various configuration files either through Ansible or the interfaces directly.
The bond configuration exists across three files on an NCN. These files may vary depending on the NCN in use:</description>

      <description>MetalLB in BGP-Mode MetalLB is a component in Kubernetes that manages access to LoadBalancer services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. There are LoadBalancer services on the Node Management Network (NMN), Hardware Management Network (HMN), and Customer Access Network (CAN).
MetalLB can run in either Layer2-mode or BGP-mode for each address pool it manages. BGP-mode is used for the NMN, HMN, and CAN. This enables true load balancing (Layer2-mode does failover, not load balancing) and allows for a more robust layer 3 configuration for these networks.</description>

      <description>Ingress Routing Ingress routing to services via Istio&amp;rsquo;s ingress gateway is configured by VirtualService custom resource definitions (CRD). When using external hostnames, there needs to be a VirtualService CRD that matches the external hostname to the desired destination.
For example, the configuration below controls the ingress routing for prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME:
ncn-w001# kubectl get vs -n sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus [services/services-gateway] [prometheus.SYSTEM_DOMAIN_NAME] 22h ncn-w001# kubectl get vs -n sysmgmt-health cray-sysmgmt-health-prometheus -o yaml apiVersion: networking.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot DNS Configuration Issues Troubleshoot issues when DNS is not properly configured to delegate name resolution to the core DNS instance on a specific cluster. Although the CAN IP address may still be routable using the IP address directly, it may not work because Istio&amp;rsquo;s ingress gateway depends on the hostname (or SNI) to route traffic. For command line tools like cURL, using the &amp;ndash;resolve option to force correct resolution can be used to work around this issue.</description>

This value is specified during the csi config init input.
It is expected to be in the static range reserved in MetalLB&amp;rsquo;s can-dynamic-pool subnet. Theoretically, this is the only CAN IP address that must be known external to the system so IT DNS can delegate the system-name.</description>

Therefore, the multi-active gateway protocol (MAGP) on the Mellanox spines can be used to create a virtual router gateway IP address that can direct to either of the spines, depending on the state of the spines.</description>

If the Customer Access Network (CAN) is not configured on the system, these services will need to be pinned to ncn-m001 because that is the only node that has external access. See Customer Access Network (CAN) for more implications if CAN is not configured.

      <description>Troubleshoot CAN Issues Various connection points to check when using the CAN and how to fix any issues that arise.
The most frequent issue with the Customer Access Network (CAN) is trouble accessing IP addresses outside of the HPE Cray EX system from a node or pod inside the system.
The best way to resolve this issue is to try to ping an outside IP address from one of the NCNs other than ncn-m001, which has a direct connection that it can use instead of the Customer Access Network (CAN).</description>

      <description>Kubernetes The system management components are broken down into a series of micro-services. Each service is independently deployable, fine-grained, and uses lightweight protocols. As a result, the system&amp;rsquo;s micro-services are modular, resilient, and can be updated independently. Services within this architecture communicate via REST APIs.
About Kubernetes Kubernetes is a portable and extensible platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes serves as a micro-services platform on the system that facilitates application deployment, scaling, and management.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes CronJobs Kubernetes CronJobs create Kubernetes jobs on a repeating schedule, specified in traditional cron syntax.
CronJobs Not Scheduled In some cases, CronJobs can fail to get scheduled (such as the cray-dns-unbound-manager job) if a previously run job did not finish properly. In order to alleviate this condition, CSM deploys a traditional CronJob on one of the master NCNs to perform cleanup such that jobs continue to get rescheduled.
In the event jobs aren&amp;rsquo;t running, ensure the CronJob is specified properly using the following steps.</description>

      <description>About etcd The system uses etcd for storing all of its cluster data. It is an open source database that is excellent for maintaining the state of Kubernetes. Failures in the etcd cluster at the heart of Kubernetes will cause a failure of Kubernetes. To mitigate this risk, the system is deployed with etcd on dedicated disks and with a specific configuration to optimize Kubernetes workloads. The system also provides additional etcd cluster(s) as necessary to help maintain an operational state of services.</description>

      <description>About Kubernetes Taints and Labels Kubernetes labels control node affinity, which is the property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes. On the other hand, Kubernetes taints enable a node to repel a set of pods. In addition, pods can have tolerances for taints to allow them to run on nodes with certain taints.
Taints are controlled with the kubectl taint nodes command, while node labels for various nodes can be customized with a configmap that contains the desired values.</description>

      <description>Hardware State Manager (HSM) State and Flag Fields HSM manages important information for hardware components in the system. Administrators can use the data returned by HSM to learn about the state of the system. To do so, it is critical that the State and Flag fields are understood, and the next steps to take are known when viewing output returned by HSM commands. It is also beneficial to understand what services can cause State or Flag changes in HSM.</description>

      <description>Hardware Management Services (HMS) Locking API The locking feature is a part of the Hardware State Manager (HSM) API. The locking API enables administrators to lock components on the system. Locking components ensures other system actors, such as administrators or running services, cannot perform a firmware update with the Firmware Action Service (FAS) or a power state change with the Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC). Locks only constrain FAS and CAPMC from each other and help ensure that a firmware update action will not be interfered with by a request to power off the device through CAPMC.</description>

      <description>VCS Branching Strategy Individual products import configuration content (Ansible plays, roles, and more) into a repository in the Version Control Service (VCS) through their installation process. Typically, this repository exists in the cray organization in VCS and its name has the format [product name]-config-management.
The import branch of the product is considered &amp;ldquo;pristine content&amp;rdquo; and is added to VCS in a read-only branch. This step is taken to ensure the future updates of the product&amp;rsquo;s configuration content can be based on a clean branch, and that upgrades can proceed without merging issues.</description>

      <description>Customize Configuration Values In general, most systems will require some customization from the default values provided by Cray products. As stated in the previous section, these changes cannot be made on the pristine product branches that are imported during product installation and upgrades. Changes can only be made in Git branches that are based on the pristine branches.
Changing or overriding default values should be done in accordance with Ansible best practices (see the external Ansible best practices guide) and variable precedence (see the external Ansible variable guide) in mind.</description>

      <description>Configuration Management of System Components The configuration of individual system components is managed with the cray cfs components command. The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) contains a database of the configuration state of available hardware known to the Hardware State Manager (HSM). When new nodes are added to the HSM database, a CFS Hardware Sync Agent enters the component into the CFS database with a null state of configuration.
Administrators are able to set a desired CFS configuration for each component, and the CFS Batcher ensures the desired configuration state and the current configuration state match.</description>

CFS also provides its Batcher component for configuration management of registered system components. The CFS Batcher periodically examines the aggregated configuration state of registered components and schedules CFS sessions against those that have not been configured to their desired state. The frequency of scheduling, the maximum number of components to schedule in the same CFS session, and the expiration time for scheduling less than full sessions are configurable.</description>

      <description>Automatic Session Deletion with sessionTTL By default, the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) will delete completed CFS sessions whose start date was more than seven days prior. Kubernetes jobs associated with these sessions will also be deleted as part of this process. This is done to ensure that CFS sessions do not accumulate and eventually adversely affect the performance of the Kubernetes cluster.
For larger systems or systems that do frequent reboots of nodes that are configured with CFS sessions, this setting may need to be reduced.</description>

      <description>Check the Progress of BOS Session Operations Describes how to view the logs of BOS operations with Kubernetes.
When a Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) session is created, it will return a job ID. This ID can be used to locate the Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) Kubernetes job that executes the session. For example:
ncn-m001# cray bos session create --template-uuid SESSIONTEMPLATE_NAME --operation Boot operation = &amp;#34;Boot&amp;#34; templateUuid = &amp;#34;TEMPLATE_UUID&amp;#34; [[links]] href = &amp;#34;foo-c7faa704-3f98-4c91-bdfb-e377a184ab4f&amp;#34; jobId = &amp;#34;boa-a939bd32-9d27-433f-afc2-735e77ec8e58&amp;#34; rel = &amp;#34;session&amp;#34; type = &amp;#34;GET&amp;#34; All BOS Kubernetes pods operate in the services namespace.</description>

      <description>Clean Up After a BOS/BOA Job is Completed or Cancelled When a BOS session is created, there are a number of items created on the system. When a session is cancelled or completed, these items need to be cleaned up to ensure there is not lingering content from the session on the system.
When a session is launched, the items below are created:

      <description>Clean Up Logs After a BOA Kubernetes Job Delete log entries from previous boot orchestration jobs. The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) launches a Boot Orchestration Agent (BOA) Kubernetes job. BOA then launches a Configuration Framework Service (CFS) session, resulting in a CFS-BOA Kubernetes job. Thus, there are two separate sets of jobs that can be removed.
Deleting log entries creates more space and helps improve the usability of viewing logs.</description>

      <description>Compute Node Boot Issue Symptom: Duplicate Address Warnings and Declined DHCP Offers in Logs If the DHCP and node logs show duplicate address warnings and indicate declined DHCP offers, it may be because another component owns the IP address that DHCP is trying to assign to a node. If this happens, the node will not accept the IP address and will repeatedly submit a DHCP discover request. As a result, the node and DHCP become entangled in a loop of requesting and rejecting.</description>

      <description>UAI macvlans Network Attachments UAIs need to be able to reach compute nodes across the node management network (NMN). When the compute node NMN is structured as multiple subnets, this requires routing form the UAIs to those subnets. The default route in a UAI goes to the public network through the Customer Access Network (CAN) so that will not work for reaching compute nodes. To solve this problem, UAS installs Kubernetes network attachments within the Kubernetes user namespace, one of which is used by UAIs.</description>

      <description>UAI Management UAS supports two manual methods and one automated method of UAI management:
 Direct administrative UAI management Legacy mode user driven UAI management UAI broker mode UAI management  Direct administrative UAI management is available mostly to allow administrators to set up UAI brokers for the UAI broker mode of UAI management and to control UAIs that are created under one of the other two methods. It is unlikely that a site will choose to create end-user UAIs this way, but it is possible to do.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot UAIs with Administrative Access Sometimes there is no better way to figure out a problem with a UAI than to get inside it and look around as an administrator. This is done using kubectl exec to start a shell inside the running container as root (in the container). With this an administrator can diagnose problems, make changes to the running UAI, and find solutions. It is important to remember that any change made inside a UAI is transitory.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot UAS by Viewing Log Output At times there will be problems with UAS. Usually this takes the form of errors showing up on CLI commands that are not immediately interpretable as some sort of input error. It is sometimes useful to examine the UAS service logs to find out what is wrong.
The first thing to do is to find out the names of the Kubernetes pods running UAS:</description>

      <description>UAI Host Node Selection When selecting UAI host nodes, it is a good idea to take into account the amount of combined load users and system services will bring to those nodes. UAIs run by default at a lower priority than system services on worker nodes which means that, if the combined load exceeds the capacity of the nodes, Kubernetes will eject UAIs and/or refuse to schedule them to protect system services.</description>

      <description>UAI Host Nodes UAIs run on Kubernetes worker nodes. There is a mechanism using Kubernetes labels to prevent UAIs from running on a specific worker node, however. Any Kubernetes node that is not labeled to prevent UAIs from running on it is considered to be a UAI host node. The administrator of a given site may control the set of UAI host nodes by labeling Kubernetes worker nodes appropriately.</description>

      <description>UAI Images There are three kinds of UAI images used by UAS:
 A pre-packaged broker UAI image provided with the UAS A pre-packaged basic end-user UAI Image provided with the UAS Custom end-user UAI images created on site, usually based on compute node contents  UAS provides two stock UAI images when installed. The first is a standard end-user UAI Image that has the necessary software installed in it to support a basic Linux distribution login experience.</description>

      <description>Select and Configure Host Nodes for UAIs Site administrators can control the set of UAI host nodes by labeling Kubernetes worker nodes appropriately.
UAIs run on NCNs that function as Kubernetes worker nodes. Use Kubernetes labels to prevent UAIs from running on one or more specific worker nodes. Any Kubernetes node that is not labeled to prevent UAIs from running on it is considered to be a UAI host node. In other words, UAI host node selection is an exclusive activity, not an inclusive one.</description>

      <description>Special Purpose UAIs Even though most UAIs are end-user UAIs, UAI classes make it possible to construct UAIs to serve special purposes that are not strictly end-user oriented.
One kind of special purpose UAI is the broker UAI, which provides on demand end-user UAI launch and management (see Broker Mode UAI Management). While no other specialty UAI types currently exist, other applications are expected to arise and users are encouraged to innovate as needed.</description>

      <description>Start a Broker UAI Create a broker UAI after a broker UAI class has been created.
Prerequisites A broker UAI class has been set up. See Configure a Broker UAI Class.
Procedure Use the following command to create a broker UAI:
ncn-m001-pit# cray uas admin uais create --class-id &amp;lt;class-id&amp;gt; [--owner &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;] To make the broker obvious in the list of UAIs, giving it an owner name of broker is handy. The owner name on a broker is used for naming and listing, but nothing else, so this is a convenient convention.</description>

      <description>Customize the Broker UAI Image The broker UAI image that comes with UAS is the image used to construct broker UAIs.
The key pieces of the broker UAI image are:
 An entrypoint shell script that initializes the container and starts the SSH daemon running. An SSH configuration that forces logged in users into the switchboard command which creates / selects end-user UAIs and redirects connections.  The primary way to customize the broker UAI image is by defining volumes and connecting them to the broker UAI class for a given broker.</description>

      <description>End-User UAIs UAIs used for interactive logins are called end-user UAIs. End-user UAIs can be seen as lightweight User Access Nodes (UANs), but there are important differences between UAIs and UANs. First, end-user UAIs are not dedicated hardware like UANs. They are implemented as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, which makes them subject to Kubernetes scheduling and resource management rules. One key element of Kubernetes orchestration is impermanence. While end-user UAIs are often long running, Kubernetes can reschedule or recreate them as needed to meet resource and node availability constraints.</description>

      <description>Create and Use Default UAIs in Legacy Mode Create a UAI using the default UAI image or the default UAI class in legacy mode.
Procedure   Create a UAI with a command of the following form:
user&amp;gt; cray uas create --public-key &#39;&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&#39; &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; is the path to a file containing an SSH public-key matched to the SSH private key belonging to the user.
  Watch the UAI and see when it is ready for logins.</description>

      <description>Create UAIs From Specific UAI Images in Legacy Mode A user can create a UAI from a specific UAI image (assuming no default UAI class exists) using a command of the form:
user&amp;gt; cray uas create --publickey &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; --imagename &amp;lt;image-name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;image-name&amp;gt; is the name shown above in the list of UAI images.
For example:
vers&amp;gt; cray uas images list default_image = &amp;quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest&amp;quot; image_list = [ &amp;quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-broker:latest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uas-sles15:latest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dtr.dev.cray.com/cray/cray-uai-sles15sp1:latest&amp;quot;,] vers&amp;gt; cray uas create --publickey ~/.</description>

      <description>Customize End-User UAI Images The provided end-user UAI image is a basic UAI image that includes an up-to-date version of the Sles Linux Distribution and client support for both the Slurm and PBS Professional workload managers. It provides an entrypoint to using UAIs and doing workload management from UAIs. This UAI image is not suitable for use with the Cray PE because it cannot be assured of being up-to-date with what is running on Shasta compute nodes at a given site.</description>

      <description>Broker Mode UAI Management A UAI broker is a special kind of UAI whose job is not to host users directly but to field attempts to reach a UAI, locate or create a UAI for the user making the attempt, and then pass the connection on to the correct UAI. Multiple UAI brokers can be created, each serving a UAI of a different class, making it possible to set up UAIs for varying workflows and environments as needed.</description>

      <description>Component Names (xnames) Component names (xnames) identify the geolocation for hardware components in the HPE Cray EX system. Every component is uniquely identified by these component names. Some, like the system cabinet number or the CDU number, can be changed by site needs. There is no geolocation encoded within the cabinet number, such as an X-Y coordinate system to relate to the floor layout of the cabinets. Other component names refer to the location within a cabinet and go down to the port on a card or switch or the socket holding a processor or a memory DIMM location.</description>

      <description>Configure a Default UAI Class for Legacy Mode Using a default UAI class is optional but recommended for any site using the legacy UAI management mode that wants to have some control over UAIs created by users. UAI classes used for this purpose need to have certain minimum configuration in them:
 The image_id field set to identify the image used to construct UAIs The volume_list field set to the list of volumes to mount in UAIs The public_ip field set to true The uai_compute_network flag set to true (if workload management will be used) The default flag set to true to make this the default UAI class  To make UAIs useful, there is a minimum set of volumes that should be defined in the UAS configuration:</description>

      <description>Configure End-User UAI Classes for Broker Mode Each UAI broker will create and manage a single class of end-user UAIs. Setting up UAI classes for this is similar to Configure a Default UAI Class for Legacy Mode with the following exceptions:
 The public_ip flag for brokered UAI classes should be set to false The default flag for brokered UAI classes may be set to true or false but should, most likely, be set to false.</description>

      <description>Configure Keycloak Account Installation of CSM software includes a default account for administrative access to keycloak.
Depending on choices made during the installation, there may be a federated connection to an external Identity Provider (IdP), such as an LDAP or AD server, which enables the use of external accounts in keycloak.
However, if the external accounts are not available, then an &amp;ldquo;internal user account&amp;rdquo; could be created in keycloak. Having a usable account in keycloak with administrative authorization enables the use of the cray CLI for many administrative commands, such as those used to Validate CSM Health and general operation of the management services via the API gateway.</description>
